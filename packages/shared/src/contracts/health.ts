/**
 * Cross-package canonical contract surface for sleep / circadian / health-metric
 * / screen-time types.
 *
 * Wave-1 (W1-B) decision: the canonical implementations of these types live
 * in `./lifeops.ts` for now — a non-app-lifeops, non-plugin-health importer
 * (`packages/scenario-runner/test/mocks/fixtures/lifeops-presence-day.ts`) requires that the types
 * stay in `@elizaos/shared`, and the cross-file dependencies inside
 * `lifeops.ts` (e.g. `LifeOpsActivitySignal.health: LifeOpsHealthSignal`,
 * `LifeOpsMobileHealthPayload.signal: LifeOpsHealthSignal`,
 * `CaptureLifeOpsActivitySignalRequest.health: LifeOpsHealthSignal | null`,
 * `LifeOpsManualOverrideResult.circadianState: LifeOpsCircadianState`) are
 * deeply interleaved with non-health types. A physical split would require
 * Wave-2 work to untangle without churn on every importer.
 *
 * Instead, this file gives plugin-health and other cross-package callers a
 * stable canonical alias to import from:
 *
 *   import type { LifeOpsHealthSignal } from "@elizaos/shared";
 *
 * The runtime semantics are identical to importing from `@elizaos/shared`
 * directly — these are pure type re-exports.
 *
 * Per `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` §3.2 / §9.4 and `wave1-interfaces.md` §5,
 * `plugin-health/src/contracts/health.ts` re-exports from this file so that
 * the plugin can be reasoned about in isolation.
