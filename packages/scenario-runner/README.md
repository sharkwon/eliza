# @elizaos/scenario-runner

End-to-end scenario runner for elizaOS agents. Loads `.scenario.ts` files, executes them against a real `AgentRuntime`, and reports pass/fail with per-turn assertion detail.

## What it is

The scenario runner is the integration-testing harness for elizaOS plugins and agent behaviour. Unlike unit tests that mock the runtime, it boots a real `AgentRuntime` backed by PGLite (an in-process Postgres) and drives it through scripted conversation turns. It is used by `packages/test/scenarios/` and by individual plugin test suites.

## Quick start

```bash
# run a single scenario directory with a live LLM provider key
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... eliza-scenarios run ./test/scenarios --scenario my-scenario-id

# deterministic mode — no LLM key required, uses the fixture-backed LLM proxy
SCENARIO_USE_DETERMINISTIC_MODEL=1 eliza-scenarios run ./test/scenarios

# list discovered scenarios without running them
eliza-scenarios list ./test/scenarios
```

## Writing a scenario

Create a `<name>.scenario.ts` file and export a `ScenarioDefinition`:

```ts
import type { ScenarioDefinition } from "@elizaos/scenario-runner/schema";

export default {
  id: "greet-happy-path",
  title: "Greeting: happy path",
  domain: "greet",
  tags: ["deterministic"],
  turns: [
    {
      name: "user says hello",
      kind: "message",
      text: "Hello",
      assertResponse(text) {
        if (!text.toLowerCase().includes("hello")) {
          return "expected a greeting in the response";
        }
      },
    },
  ],
  finalChecks: [
    { type: "actionCalled", name: "REPLY called", actionName: "REPLY", minCount: 1 },
  ],
} satisfies ScenarioDefinition;
```

### Turn kinds

| Kind | What it does |
|---|---|
| `message` | Sends text through `runtime.messageService.handleMessage` (full conversational path) |
| `action` | Calls a named action's `validate` + `handler` directly (bypasses LLM routing) |
| `api` | Makes an HTTP request to the agent's registered routes via a loopback server |
| `tick` | Invokes the lifeops scheduler at a logical clock time |

### Assertions

**Per-turn:**
- `assertResponse(text | status, body)` — return a non-empty string to fail
- `assertTurn(execution)` — inspect the full `ScenarioTurnExecution`
- `responseIncludesAny: string[]` — response must contain at least one
- `forbiddenActions: string[]` — scenario fails if any of these actions fire
- `responseJudge: { rubric, minimumScore }` — LLM-as-judge scoring

**Final checks** (after all turns, in `finalChecks` array):
`actionCalled`, `selectedAction`, `judgeRubric`, `connectorDispatchOccurred`, `memoryWriteOccurred`, `approvalRequestExists`, `browserTaskCompleted`, `messageDelivered`, and more — see `schema/index.js` for the full list.

## CLI flags

```
eliza-scenarios run  <dir>
  --report <path>          Write JSON aggregate report
  --report-dir <dir>       Write report bundle to directory
  --run-dir <dir>          Store per-turn trajectories here
  --export-native <path>   Export trajectory JSONL for training corpus
  --runId <id>             Override the auto-generated run UUID
  --scenario id1,id2       Filter to specific scenario IDs
  [fileGlob ...]           Filter by file glob pattern
```

## Provider-qualified release evidence

The ordinary executor is an in-process diagnostic harness. It can exercise a
real model and real plugin code, but it creates scenario identities and invokes
the runtime directly, so it is never a trustworthy provider-evidence boundary.
Declaring `executionProfile: "provider-qualified"` does not relabel that path:
the executor fails closed, mixed-profile or multi-scenario runs are rejected,
and the CLI returns nonzero and withholds native export unless exactly one
report carries independently verified, publishable qualification.

An out-of-process controller can use the public primitives under
`src/provider-qualified/` to:

1. build a closed, content-hashed run manifest bound to deployment, principal,
   room, every connector account/capability, and the exact required
   observations;
2. drive authenticated production ingress while independent observers collect
   provider, durable-database, and scheduler evidence;
3. recompute exact trajectory and stage hashes from a fresh isolated run
   directory; and
4. derive qualification from a pinned Ed25519 observer signature, exact
   observation/result multisets, independent semantic verdicts, provider
   acceptance, and required readback/idempotency.

The qualifier always records `exactlyOnce: false`; provider idempotency and
readback reduce ambiguity but do not prove end-to-end exactly-once delivery.
Action results, model prose, loopback fixtures, local PGlite, and unsigned
same-process observations cannot satisfy these contracts.

## Key env vars

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `SCENARIO_USE_DETERMINISTIC_MODEL=1` | Use deterministic fixture-based LLM proxy (no API key needed) |
| `LIFEOPS_LIVE_JUDGE_MIN_SCORE` | Minimum judge score threshold (default: `0.8`) |
| `SKIP_REASON` | Set to allow intentional scenario skips without exit code 2 |
| `SCENARIO_INCLUDE_PENDING` | `1` = include `status: "pending"` scenarios |
| `ELIZA_BENCH_SKIP_EMBEDDING` | Default `1`; set to `0` for real local-inference embeddings |
| `ELIZA_TRAJECTORY_LOGGING` | The `run` command sets this to `1` when the operator has not already set it, so scenario trajectories are recorded even under `NODE_ENV=test` or `NODE_ENV=production`; explicit `0` and `ELIZA_DISABLE_TRAJECTORY_LOGGING=1` are respected |
| `ELIZA_TRAJECTORY_DIR` | Set automatically when `--run-dir` or `--export-native` creates an effective run directory; otherwise the recorder falls back to the state-dir trajectories path |

Any one of `GROQ_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`, or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` satisfies the live-provider requirement when not in proxy mode.

## Programmatic use

```ts
import { createScenarioRuntime } from "./src/runtime-factory.ts";
import { runScenario }           from "@elizaos/scenario-runner";

const { runtime, providerName, cleanup } = await createScenarioRuntime();
const report = await runScenario(myScenario, runtime, {
  providerName,
  minJudgeScore: 0.8,
  turnTimeoutMs: 120_000,
});
await cleanup();
```

## Notes

- A simulated CLI invocation runs its scenarios in one shared runtime because PGLite cannot be recreated in-process. Provider-qualified definitions are restricted to one scenario and still require an external production controller; the ordinary executor deliberately refuses to qualify them.
- Schema types (`ScenarioDefinition`, `CapturedAction`, etc.) come from `@elizaos/scenario-runner/schema`, not from the main export.
- Scenarios starting with `_` or in directories starting with `_` are skipped by the loader.
