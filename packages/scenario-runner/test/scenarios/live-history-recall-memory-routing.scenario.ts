/**
 * Live proof for the Stage-1 history-capability gate (#17564, with-MEMORY
 * branch): on a runtime whose role-visible MEMORY action exposes op:search,
 * a beyond-window count question ("how many times have i mentioned bitcoin")
 * must route to the stored record instead of being answered — or denied —
 * from the visible message window alone (live regression tj-69d82bb89ebb69).
 *
 * Seeds a stored conversation with three bitcoin mentions, asks the count
 * question through the full live pipeline, and requires a real MEMORY action
 * invocation plus a count-shaped answer. The paired scenario
 * live-history-recall-honest-denial covers the no-executable-action branch.
