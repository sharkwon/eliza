// Deterministic INBOUND attachment coverage (#8876): a user message that
// carries a `Media` attachment must flow end-to-end through a real AgentRuntime
// under the mock (deterministic) LLM and produce a reply — i.e. an inbound
// attachment never breaks the message pipeline. (Media GENERATION is covered by
// deterministic-media-actions.scenario.ts; the agent-facing read tool is
// the core `ATTACHMENT` action, unit-tested in core.) The attachment is
// surfaced into the agent's context with its stored-content hint, and the agent
// replies. Runs keyless + strict under the deterministic model provider.
