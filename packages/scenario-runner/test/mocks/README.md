# LifeOps External API Mocks

This directory contains Mockoon-compatible environment files that emulate the
external HTTP APIs LifeOps integrates with. Tests serve these files through the
in-process fixture runner in `scripts/start-mocks.ts` and point LifeOps clients
at those local URLs via env vars instead of hitting real services.

Each LifeOps client reads its env var on import and falls back to the real URL
when unset. These env vars are test-only: the normal `bun run dev` launcher now
strips inherited `ELIZA_MOCK_*` values so local development keeps using real
Google/Twilio/etc. unless you opt back in explicitly. See the patched files in
`eliza/plugins/plugin-personal-assistant/src/lifeops/`:

- `twilio.ts`, `whatsapp-client.ts`, `calendly-client.ts`
- `x-poster.ts`, `x-reader.ts`
- `google-fetch.ts` (rewrites all `*.googleapis.com` + `accounts.google.com`)
- `google-oauth.ts` (token + userinfo go through the same rewrite helper)

## Run mocks in tests

```ts
import { startMocks } from "./scripts/start-mocks.ts";

const mocks = await startMocks({ envs: ["google", "twilio"] });
process.env.ELIZA_MOCK_GOOGLE_BASE = mocks.baseUrls.google;
process.env.ELIZA_MOCK_TWILIO_BASE = mocks.baseUrls.twilio;
await mocks.stop();
```

Use the dedicated test helpers or test commands for this. Do not export
`ELIZA_MOCK_GOOGLE_BASE` in your regular shell before running `bun run dev`
unless you are intentionally debugging the mock path.

## Clean up a polluted dev profile

If the chat sidebar already shows old synthetic Google Calendar rows from a
past mock run:

1. Start the app normally with `bun run dev` so the dev launcher strips any
   leaked `ELIZA_MOCK_*` vars.
2. In the app, disconnect the Google LifeOps connector once.
3. Reconnect Google so LifeOps clears the cached mock rows and resyncs from the
   real account.

The Google disconnect flow already clears cached calendar events, Gmail cache,
and sync state for the disconnected connector.

Ports are auto-assigned on `127.0.0.1`. The fixture runner supports the subset
of Mockoon templating used by these files: `{{body 'field'}}`,
`{{urlParam 'id'}}`, `{{faker '...'}}`, and `{{now '...'}}`.

## Run with Mockoon manually

Mockoon is optional for editing or manual inspection of the same JSON files.

```bash
bunx @mockoon/cli start --data test/mocks/environments/twilio.json
# ... or all HTTP fixture files in parallel:
bunx @mockoon/cli start \
  --data test/mocks/environments/twilio.json \
  --data test/mocks/environments/whatsapp.json \
  --data test/mocks/environments/calendly.json \
  --data test/mocks/environments/x-twitter.json \
  --data test/mocks/environments/google.json \
  --data test/mocks/environments/cloud-managed.json \
  --data test/mocks/environments/signal.json \
  --data test/mocks/environments/browser-workspace.json \
  --data test/mocks/environments/bluebubbles.json \
  --data test/mocks/environments/github.json \
  --data test/mocks/environments/payments.json \
  --data test/mocks/environments/lifeops-presence-active.json
```

Then point the clients at the mocks:

```bash
export ELIZA_MOCK_TWILIO_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:3001
export ELIZA_MOCK_WHATSAPP_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:3002
export ELIZA_MOCK_CALENDLY_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:3003
export ELIZA_MOCK_X_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:3004
export ELIZA_MOCK_GOOGLE_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:3005
export SIGNAL_HTTP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3006
export SIGNAL_ACCOUNT_NUMBER=+15550000000
export ELIZA_BROWSER_WORKSPACE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3007
export ELIZA_BROWSER_WORKSPACE_TOKEN=mock-browser-workspace-token
export ELIZA_DISABLE_DISCORD_DESKTOP_CDP=1
export ELIZA_IMESSAGE_BACKEND=bluebubbles
export ELIZA_BLUEBUBBLES_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3008
export ELIZA_BLUEBUBBLES_PASSWORD=mock-bluebubbles-password
export ELIZA_MOCK_GITHUB_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:3009
export ELIZA_MOCK_PAYMENT_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:3010
export ELIZA_MOCK_PAYMENTS_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:3010
export ELIZA_MOCK_LIFEOPS_PRESENCE_ACTIVE_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:3011
```

## Test usage

Call `startMocks` from `scripts/start-mocks.ts`, register the returned env vars,
and construct the real runtime for the package under test. The fixture servers
replace only external HTTP APIs; they do not replace the elizaOS runtime or
model layer. Deterministic model responses come from
`createDeterministicModelPlugin` in `@elizaos/core/testing` and must be declared
explicitly by the consuming test.

Run the mock contract tests from the repo root with:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/scenario-runner test -- test/mocks/__tests__/
```

LifeOps runtime seeds and simulator helpers live under
`plugins/plugin-personal-assistant/test/support`.

## Google / Gmail mock coverage

`environments/google.json` is the local Gmail/Google fixture used by
`ELIZA_MOCK_GOOGLE_BASE`. The in-process runner also adds Gmail-specific
dynamic routes for surfaces LifeOps needs for read, send, and inbox-zero
development:

- message list/get/send/modify plus batch modify/delete
- message attachment metadata and download
- message trash, untrash, and delete
- label list, including system labels and the `eliza-e2e` user label
- draft create/list/get/send/delete
- thread list/get/modify/trash/untrash
- watch and history list
- settings filter creation for unsubscribe/archive flows

This fixture is intentionally deterministic and synthetic. It is not a full
Gmail search engine: the in-process runner matches method plus path, while query
parameters, auth scopes, request-body validation, pagination, and rate-limit
variants need a stateful Gmail fixture service or a richer runner layer. Keep
real mailbox captures out of this directory unless they have gone through a
redaction and fixture-validation pipeline.

## Non-Google dynamic mock coverage

The in-process runner adds stateful contract routes for these provider files:

- X read/search/DM surfaces: `/2/dm_events`, home timeline, mentions, recent
  search, tweet create, and DM send.
- WhatsApp send plus inbound webhook ingestion at `/webhook` and
  `/webhooks/whatsapp`; the buffered webhook messages are visible through the
  test-only `/__mock/whatsapp/inbound` route.
- Signal local HTTP receive/send: `/api/v1/check`, `/api/v1/rpc`,
  `/v1/receive/:account`, and `/v2/send`.
- Discord browser workspace bridge routes: `/tabs`, `/tabs/:id/navigate`,
  `/tabs/:id/eval`, `/tabs/:id/show`, `/tabs/:id/hide`,
  `/tabs/:id/snapshot`, and tab close.
- BlueBubbles iMessage routes: server info, chat query, message query/search,
  message send, chat messages, and message detail.
- GitHub REST fixtures for PR list/review, issue create/assign, search, and
  notifications. `helpers/github-octokit-fixture.ts` also exports a reusable
  Octokit-shaped fixture for plugin unit tests.

Telegram is intentionally not represented as an HTTP mock here. LifeOps uses
MTProto through `telegram-local-client.ts` and already exposes a dependency
injection seam (`TelegramLocalClientDeps`) for tests. Adding a fake Telegram
HTTP gateway would not match a real consumer path.

## Presence-active interaction scenario mocks

`fixtures/lifeops-presence-active.ts` is the executable catalog for the seven assistant
interaction moves from the Sam/Theodore setup and email scene: intake
affect, assistant identity, permissioned context scan, bulk email curation,
contact resolution, document review, and proactive multi-hop follow-up.

The in-process runner serves the catalog only from the `lifeops-presence-active` mock
base URL:

- `GET /__mock/lifeops/presence-active/scenarios` returns scenario summaries, provider
  coverage, API example counts, and edge-case counts.
- `GET /__mock/lifeops/presence-active/scenarios/:id` returns the full scenario with
  lined-up mock records, API examples, expected workflow, assertions, safety
  gates, and edge cases.
- `POST /__mock/lifeops/presence-active/tasks` starts a synthetic long-running task for
  the multi-hop vendor packet scenario.
- `GET /__mock/lifeops/presence-active/tasks/:id` returns the current deterministic
  task snapshot without advancing it.
- `POST /__mock/lifeops/presence-active/tasks/:id/advance` moves the in-process task
  through queued, running, waiting-for-input, and completed snapshots.

For manual Mockoon API testing, load
`test/mocks/environments/lifeops-presence-active.json`. It exposes representative local
LifeOps endpoints for first-run affect, organization scans, email curation,
explicit preference memory, contact resolution, document proofread,
long-running task polling, task advance, and edge variants for provider
downtime, ambiguous recipients, too-broad bulk email requests, and rate limits.
The standalone Mockoon file is stateless; full task progression is provided by
the in-process `startMocks` runner. Provider API examples are static contract
checks against the provider mocks above, so complex tests can combine the
scenario catalog with Gmail, GitHub, Signal, BlueBubbles, and browser-workspace
requests.

## Provider coverage and remaining gaps

The executable source of truth for this table is
`helpers/provider-coverage.ts`; `provider-coverage-contract.test.ts` fails when
a required LifeOps provider, mock environment, validation file, or documented gap
falls out of sync.
