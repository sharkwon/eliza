/**
 * Judge-independence governance (#9310).
 *
 * When no independent Cerebras judge is configured, judge.ts falls back to the
 * runtime's own TEXT_LARGE model — the model under test grades itself. These
 * tests prove that self-grading is fail-loud-visible:
 *
 *   - the scenario report is stamped `judgeSelfGraded: true`,
 *   - `SCENARIO_JUDGE_REQUIRE_INDEPENDENT=1` turns the self-graded scenario
 *     into a failure (the nightly live lane sets it),
 *   - deterministic-proxy lanes (fixture-served judges) are NOT stamped,
 *   - scenarios that never ran a judge are NOT stamped.
