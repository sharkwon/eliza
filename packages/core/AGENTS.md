# @elizaos/core

The runtime heart of elizaOS: `AgentRuntime`, the plugin abstractions (actions / providers / evaluators / services / models / routes / events), the canonical type system, and the supporting subsystems (memory, search, settings, scheduling, prompts). Almost every other `@elizaos/*` package and plugin imports from here.

## Role

`@elizaos/core` defines the contracts an Eliza agent runs on and the runtime that executes them. Plugins implement `Plugin` and the runtime wires their actions/providers/evaluators/services into the message-handling loop. Consumed by `@elizaos/agent` (which also hosts the HTTP API server), `@elizaos/app-core` (the API + dashboard host), and every plugin. It builds to three targets (Node, browser, edge) via conditional exports — keep Node-only code out of the browser/edge entries.

## Key exports / surface

From `@elizaos/core` (`index.node.ts`):
- `AgentRuntime` — the runtime, `implements IAgentRuntime`.
- Plugin machinery: `loadPlugin`, `resolvePlugins`, `validatePlugin`, `isValidPluginShape`, `normalizePluginName`, `resolvePluginDependencies`.
- `logger` (re-exported from `./logger`) — the structured logger all packages use.
- Type contracts: `Plugin`, `Action`, `Provider`, `Evaluator`, `Service`, `IAgentRuntime`, `IDatabaseAdapter`, `Memory`, `State`, `Character`, `ModelType`, `UUID`, plus everything in `types/`.
- Built-in capability bundle: `basicCapabilities` / `basicActions` / `basicProviders` / `basicEvaluators` / `basicServices` (from `features/basic-capabilities/index.ts`).
- Boot/composition (Node): `loadCharacters`, `createRuntimes`, `buildBaseTables`, `InMemoryDatabaseAdapter`.
- Prompt + model helpers: `composePromptFromState`, `parseKeyValueXml`, `callModelWithValidation`, `parseAndValidate`.

Subpath entries (see `package.json` `exports`): `@elizaos/core/node`, `@elizaos/core/browser`, `@elizaos/core/roles`, `@elizaos/core/testing`, `@elizaos/core/services/*`.

This package does NOT export a `corePlugin` singleton — the foundational actions/providers/evaluators/services live in `features/basic-capabilities` and are exported as the `basic*` bundles above.

## Commands

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/core build         # multi-target build via build.ts (Node + browser + edge + d.ts)
bun run --cwd packages/core build:node    # Node target only
bun run --cwd packages/core build:watch   # watch build (alias: dev)
bun run --cwd packages/core test          # vitest run (via ../scripts/run-vitest.mjs)
bun run --cwd packages/core test:watch    # vitest watch
bun run --cwd packages/core test:coverage # vitest with v8 coverage
bun run --cwd packages/core test:e2e      # Playwright (playwright.config.ts)
bun run --cwd packages/core test:e2e:smoke
bun run --cwd packages/core typecheck     # tsgo --noEmit -p ./tsconfig.json
bun run --cwd packages/core lint          # biome check --write ./src
bun run --cwd packages/core format        # biome format --write ./src
bun run --cwd packages/core clean         # remove dist + emitted src artifacts
```

`prebuild` builds logger and cloud-routing, then generates `src/i18n/generated/validation-keyword-data.ts` if missing. Runtime-owned contracts are compiled with core.

## Config / env vars

Read by the runtime (see README for the full WHY of each):
- `LOG_LEVEL`, `LOG_JSON_FORMAT`, `LOG_FILE` — logger behavior (`src/logger.ts`).
- `SECRET_SALT` — encryption salt, read by `getSalt()` in `src/settings.ts` (`ELIZA_ALLOW_DEFAULT_SECRET_SALT` overrides the production non-default check).
- `ALLOW_NO_DATABASE` — fall back to `InMemoryDatabaseAdapter` on `initialize()` when no adapter is provided (`runtime.ts`).
- `SHOULD_RESPOND_MODEL` (`small`/`large`, `services/message.ts`), `BASIC_CAPABILITIES_KEEP_RESP` (`services/message.ts`) — message/basic-capabilities behavior.
- `ELIZA_BOT_NOISE_TRIAGE` (`services/message/bot-noise-triage.ts`) — set `0` to disable the TEXT_SMALL pre-gate that triages unaddressed bot/webhook group messages before the Stage 1 RESPONSE_HANDLER call (default on).
- `ELIZA_STAGE1_GROUP_TRIAGE` (`services/message/stage1-prompt-tier.ts`) — set `0` to disable the compact Stage 1 instruction tier for unaddressed group messages and always render the full rule block (default on).
- Prompt-batcher knobs (all `PROMPT_BATCHER_*`, read in `runtime.ts`): `PROMPT_BATCHER_BATCH_SIZE`, `PROMPT_BATCHER_MAX_DRAIN_INTERVAL_MS`, `PROMPT_BATCHER_MAX_SECTIONS_PER_CALL`, `PROMPT_BATCHER_PACKING_DENSITY`, `PROMPT_BATCHER_MAX_TOKENS_PER_CALL`, `PROMPT_BATCHER_MAX_PARALLEL_CALLS`, `PROMPT_BATCHER_MODEL_SEPARATION`.
- `ELIZA_STATE_DIR` — state-dir resolution (`utils/state-dir.ts`); `ELIZA_WORKSPACE_DIR` — workspace folder (`utils/workspace-folder-config.ts`).
- `ELIZA_TRAJECTORY_LOGGING` — canonical trajectory persistence gate for both file and DB recorders (`runtime/trajectory-gate.ts`): truthy enables; non-empty falsey disables; blank is unset. Defaults are on for dev/unset `NODE_ENV`, off for `NODE_ENV=test|production`. `ELIZA_TRAJECTORY_RECORDING` is the legacy alias, and `ELIZA_DISABLE_TRAJECTORY_LOGGING=1` is the hard opt-out.

Prefer the canonical env reader in `utils/read-env.ts` over raw `process.env` (it handles legacy aliases).

### Setting / env resolution — precedence & the multi-tenant rule

Two canonical helpers own all setting/env resolution; everything else delegates:

| Helper | Source order | Use when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `runtime.getSetting(key)` (`runtime.ts`) | character secrets → character settings → `settings.extra` → `settings.secrets` → `character.env.vars` → the constructor-provided `settings` map. **Never `process.env`.** | Inside the runtime / framework code. |
| `readEnv(key, opts)` (`utils/read-env.ts`) | `process.env[key]` (trimmed; empty string treated as unset) → `defaultValue`. | Reading an env var with no runtime in scope. |
| `resolveSetting(runtime, key, opts)` (`utils/resolve-setting.ts`) | `runtime.getSetting(key)` (coerced to string) → `readEnv(key)` → `defaultValue`. | Single-tenant / headless plugins that still want a dotenv fallback. |

**Resolution order:** runtime/character setting → env alias → default. The
per-agent runtime value always wins; the env fallback is the deployment default.

**WHY core `getSetting()` deliberately does NOT read `process.env`:** in a
multi-tenant process many agents share one OS environment. If `getSetting()`
fell through to `process.env`, a host secret (`OPENAI_API_KEY`,
`POSTGRES_URL`, …) set for the *box* would silently leak into *every* agent,
including ones the operator never granted it to. Keeping `getSetting()`
per-agent makes each agent's config explicit and isolated. `resolveSetting`
re-adds an opt-in env fallback for single-tenant/headless plugins **without**
changing `getSetting()` semantics — multi-tenant hosts that never call it are
unaffected.

**Host obligation (how to make dotenv values visible to `getSetting()`):**
because `getSetting()` reads the constructor-provided `settings` map and not
`process.env`, a host that wants `.env` / `process.env` values honored must fold
them into the runtime's settings at construction. `getBasicCapabilitiesSettings(character, env)`
(`runtime-composition.ts`) does exactly this — it flattens `character.settings`,
`character.secrets`, and `env` into the `Record<string,string>` handed to
adapter factories and the `AgentRuntime` constructor. Construct the runtime with
those settings and dotenv is honored; skip it and only character config is
visible.

## How to extend

- **Add an action/provider/evaluator/service to the built-in bundle:** implement against the `Action`/`Provider`/`Evaluator`/`Service` types in `types/`, then add it to the relevant array in `src/features/basic-capabilities/index.ts` (`basicActions`, `basicProviders`, `basicEvaluators`, `basicServices`). Most new capabilities should live in their own plugin package instead of here.
- **Add a runtime type/contract:** define it under `src/types/<area>.ts` or the owning `src/contracts/` domain and export it through the narrowest stable subpath. Cross-host contracts that do not belong to the runtime live under `@elizaos/shared/contracts`.
- **Add a DB table:** extend the schema in `src/schemas/` and wire it into `buildBaseTables` (`schemas/index.ts`); adapters in plugin-sql/localdb materialize it.
- **Touching the message loop:** the order is provider → model → action → evaluator. Logic lives in `src/runtime/` (`message-handler.ts`, `planner-loop.ts`, `turn-controller.ts`) and `runtime.ts`. Validated model output goes through `runtime/validated-model-call.ts`.
- **Browser/edge surface:** if your code is Node-only (fs, process, native deps), export it from `index.node.ts` only — never add it to `index.browser.ts` / `index.edge.ts`.

## Conventions / gotchas

- `index.node.ts` is the source of truth for the root public surface; narrow contract consumers should prefer `@elizaos/core/contracts/*` subpaths to avoid barrel collisions.
- Three build targets share source — Node-only imports in shared modules break the browser/edge bundles. Verify with `build:node` vs full `build`.
- The model-output contract is `<response>` XML (with `<actions>`/`<providers>`/`<text>`); plain text is tolerated and treated as a `REPLY`.
- DB mutation methods on `IDatabaseAdapter` return `Promise<boolean>` so callers can distinguish success/failure (`types/database.ts`).
- The task system (`services/task.ts`, `services/task-scheduler.ts`) is the single place scheduled work runs; only tasks tagged `queue` are polled. Three modes: local timer, per-daemon (`startTaskScheduler`), serverless (`{ serverless: true }` + `runDueTasks()`).
- `runtime.ts` is very large (~9000 lines / ~259 KB) — navigate by symbol, not by reading top-to-bottom.
- `src/generated/` and parts of `src/i18n/generated/` are build artifacts; regenerate via prebuild rather than editing.
- Repo-wide rules (logger-only, ESM, naming, architecture) are in the root [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) — not restated here.

## ⛔ NON-NEGOTIABLE — evidence, trajectories & real end-to-end tests

> The binding, repo-wide standard is **[AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)**. Read it.
> Nothing in this package is *done* until it is *proven* done — a reviewer must confirm it
> works **without reading the code**, from the artifacts you attach. This applies to **every**
> feature, fix, refactor, and chore here. "Tests pass" is not proof; "CI is green" is not proof.

- **Record AND read model trajectories.** Capture the *actual* inputs and outputs of the model
  from a **live** LLM — not the deterministic proxy, not a mock: the prompt, the
  providers/context, the raw model output, every tool/action call, and the result. Then **open
  the trajectory and review it by hand.** A captured-but-unread trajectory is not evidence
  (`packages/scenario-runner/bin/eliza-scenarios run <scenario> --report <out>`).
- **Real, full-featured E2E — no larp.** Every feature ships detailed end-to-end tests that
  drive the *real* path end to end. Not the happy "front door" only: cover error paths,
  edge/empty/invalid input, concurrency, roles/permissions, and adversarial input. A test that
  asserts against a mock/stub/fixture standing in for the thing under test **does not count**.
  If the real model/device/chain/connector/account is hard to reach, **make it reachable — that
  is the work**, not an excuse to mock. If the existing tests here are shallow or mocked, fixing
  them is part of your change.
- **Screenshots + logs at every phase**, plus a **complete walkthrough video/run-through** of
  the entire feature or view, start to finish (`bun run test:e2e:record`).
- **Manually review every artifact the change touches** — never just the green check: client
  logs (console + network), server logs (`[ClassName] …`), the model trajectories in and out,
  before/after full-page screenshots, **and the domain artifacts listed below for this package.**
- **No residuals. No shortcuts.** The goal is not "done" — it is *everything* done. Clear every
  blocker by the **hard path**: build the real architecture, stand up the real
  model/device/service, actually test it. Never leave a TODO, a stub, a stepping-stone, or a
  "follow-up." When unsure, research thoroughly, weigh the options, and ship the best,
  highest-effort, production-ready version. Keep going until every possibility is exhausted.

Artifacts → attached inline in the PR (MP4 video, JPG screenshots, logs in `<details>`); attach each evidence type **or**
explicitly mark it N/A with a reason — never leave it blank. If `develop` moved and changed
behavior, **re-capture** evidence; stale proof is worse than none.

**Capture & manually review for this package — runtime / framework:**
- A **live-LLM** scenario trajectory for the runtime path you touched — provider → model → action → evaluator — with the raw `<response>` XML and every tool/action call visible and **read**.
- Backend `[ClassName]` logs proving the message loop, task scheduler, or service actually fired end to end.
- The memory/state artifacts produced — rows written, embeddings, room/world/entity records, scheduled-task rows — inspected, not assumed.
- For shared modules: `build:node` vs full `build` so the browser/edge bundles still compile.
