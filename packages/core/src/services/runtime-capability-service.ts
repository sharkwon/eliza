/**
 * RuntimeCapabilityService — the single owner of
 * {@link CAPABILITY_ROUTER_SERVICE_TYPE}.
 *
 * P0 step 6/6 of the Plugin/mode unification (see architecture-review v3).
 *
 * This file replaces the historical trio of competing capability routers:
 *
 * - `RuntimeBrokerCapabilityRouter` (a bare class in
 *   `packages/core/src/capabilities/index.ts` — see {@link
 *   RuntimeBrokerCapabilityRouter})
 * - `RemoteCapabilityRouterService` (the `Service` subclass in
 *   `packages/agent/src/services/remote-capability-router.ts`)
 * - the parallel `E2BRemoteCapabilityRouterService` from PR #7779
 *
 * Each registered against the same {@link CAPABILITY_ROUTER_SERVICE_TYPE}
 * slot, and the routing strategy (local vs. remote vs. cloud-sandbox) was
 * encoded by *which Service got registered first* — a fragile arrangement
 * that this class collapses into a single Service whose **strategy table**
 * is the explicit routing decision.
 *
 * The strategies (`LocalPluginStrategy`, `HttpEndpointStrategy`,
 * `CompositeStrategy`, `UnavailableStrategy`) materialise in subsequent
 * P0 follow-ups; P0 ships this shell with the canonical type surface so
 * downstream consumers can begin migrating to
 * `runtime.getService(CAPABILITY_ROUTER_SERVICE_TYPE)` semantics without
 * caring whether the underlying dispatch is local-RemotePlugin or remote-HTTP.
 *
 * The router classes named above remain in the tree during P0; P1 deletes
 * them and folds their dispatch logic into the strategies declared below.
