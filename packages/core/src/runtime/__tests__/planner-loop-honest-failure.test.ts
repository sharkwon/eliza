/**
 * Honest failed-turn replies (#17948): a planner turn that ends on a failed

 * results, and multi-step turns that fail late. Also pins the hygiene of the
 * prompt context the loop adds (scrubbed causes, no absolute paths or ids)
 * and the J4 degrade when the synthesis model call itself fails.
 * Deterministic — `useModel`, `executeToolCall`, and `evaluate` are vitest
