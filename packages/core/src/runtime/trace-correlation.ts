 * The correlation header that joins the three otherwise-disjoint trace stores —
 * the file `RecordedTrajectory` (trajectory-recorder.ts), the DB
 * `TrajectoriesService`, and the orchestrator's `OrchestratorTaskDocument`
 * (#13775). The schemas are NOT merged (different consumers); each carries this
 * additive envelope so a parent turn, its DB row, and any sub-agent trajectory
 * it spawned can be stitched back together on a single `traceId`.
 *
 * `traceId` is minted at the root turn (message.ts) and propagated to spawned
 * sub-agents through the env vars below; a sub-agent's own recorder reads them
 * back via {@link resolveTraceCorrelationFromEnv} so its inner model
 * prompts/responses land under the parent's trace.
