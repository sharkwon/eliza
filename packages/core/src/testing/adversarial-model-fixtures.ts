/**
 * Incorrect model responses used to exercise real runtime failure paths.
 *
 * The deterministic provider can emit deliberately wrong model output so a plugin
 * author can prove their action degrades safely instead of silently succeeding.
 * This codifies the negative cases the issue calls for — malformed JSON, a
 * wrong tool, a hallucinated (non-existent) tool, empty output, and a truncated
 * (`finishReason: "length"`) response — as a reusable pack rather than per-test
 * reinvention.
 *
 * The correct/incorrect contract:
 *  - The correct path is declared with `./deterministic-action-fixtures.ts`'s
 *    {@link strictActionRouteFixtures} (exact tool-call, validated).
 *  - The incorrect path is declared here. The provider returns it verbatim so
 *    it reaches the runtime; the test then asserts the
 *    runtime/plugin surfaces an error, retries, or falls back — never a silent
 *    success. The Stage-1 routing fixture stays valid, isolating the failure to
 *    the planner (the realistic "model picked the right action but botched the
 *    tool call" case).
