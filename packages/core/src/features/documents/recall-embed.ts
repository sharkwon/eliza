/**
 * THE shared recall-query embedder on the reply hot path.
 *
 * Every recall provider that embeds the current user message to vector-search
 * memory routes through here: document/knowledge recall
 * (`DocumentService._vectorSearch`/`_hybridSearch`), experience recall
 * (`ExperienceService.findSimilarExperiences`), and the relevant-conversations
 * provider. Because they all call this one function with the same runtime +
 * `runId` + (normalized) query text, the per-turn dedupe below collapses the
 * 3 independent embed round-trips per turn into a single one.
 *
 * **Per-turn cache + in-flight dedupe.** The same query text is embedded more
 * than once per turn (vector + hybrid document search, experience recall,
 * relevant-conversations). Identical normalized query text within one turn
 * resolves to a single embed call; concurrent identical embeds share one
 * in-flight promise. The cache is scoped to the turn and evicted when a new
 * turn's key is observed, so it never grows unbounded.
 *
 * **Turn key = `runId`, plus a `messageId` that survives the run transition.**
 * The API chat path embeds the user query during document augmentation *before*
 * `startRun`. `AgentRuntime.getCurrentRunId()` lazily mints a transient run id
 * there, so the augmentation embed would otherwise cache under an id that
 * `startRun` immediately replaces — orphaning the vector and forcing a second
 * identical embed in-run. Augmentation therefore also presents the turn's
 * `messageId`; the in-run TTFT prefetch presents the same `messageId` and ADOPTS
 * the slot, re-stamping it with the real `runId` so every later `runId`-only
 * recall caller (compose-time providers) shares the already-warmed vector
 * instead of issuing a second round-trip. A `runId`-only caller never adopts a
 * slot without a `messageId` match, so a concurrent turn's vectors can never be
 * attributed to the wrong turn (worst case: a cache miss, never a wrong vector).
 * A caller with neither key (background/non-turn) embeds directly, uncached.
 *
 * **Alias keys for rewritten prompts.** Document augmentation rewrites the
 * turn's `content.text` into a contextual-documents envelope AFTER the recall
 * embed of the clean user prompt already ran. Every in-run recall caller then
 * presents the envelope text, whose normalized key would miss the cached
 * vector and issue a second, serial embed round-trip for the same turn.
 * `aliasRecallQuery` lets the rewriter declare both texts equivalent for this
 * turn's recall, mapping the envelope key onto the clean-prompt vector — which
 * is also the semantically correct recall query (the user's request, not the
 * injected document context).
 *
 * **Fail-open on error only.** A failed embed (the model handler rejects — e.g.
 * its own request timeout aborts, or the provider errors) returns `null`; the
 * caller falls open to keyword/BM25 recall (or, for callers with no keyword
 * path, to empty recall context) — recall richness is lost, but the reply is
 * never blocked on an *error*. The provider owns diagnosis of a typed, expected
 * capability-unavailable state; every unexpected failure is reported here with
 * a stable recall code so it remains eligible for runtime diagnostics and
 * escalation without turning a known missing capability into chat noise.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO app-level latency timeout here. A short, arbitrary
 * race on every healthy-but-slow embed would silently degrade vector recall to
 * keyword-only every turn — a feature-kill switch, not a circuit breaker.
 * Bounding a *hung* request is the embedding model handler's job (it owns a
 * real, cancelable request timeout); keeping that bound at the request layer
 * means a slow embed either completes (rich recall) or genuinely errors
 * (fail-open), with no silent middle ground.
