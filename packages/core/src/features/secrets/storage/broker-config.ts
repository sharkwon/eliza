/**
 * Vendor-neutral secrets-broker configuration (issue #11536, phase E4).
 *
 * E4 gives the secrets feature a pluggable EXTERNAL-BROKER backend. The local
 * AES-GCM stores (memory/character/world/component) remain the DEFAULT; the
 * broker backend is an OPT-IN option for "eliza enterprise" deployments where
 * the operator must prove the runtime CANNOT exfiltrate tenant credentials
 * because it never holds the plaintext.
 *
 * Config names mirror the E1/E2 `ELIZA_MODEL_GATEWAY_*` and E3
 * `ELIZA_CREDENTIAL_PROXY_*` conventions exactly, keeping the whole federation
 * surface greppable and vendor-neutral. Steward is the REFERENCE broker, never
 * a branded import or hard dependency:
 *   - `ELIZA_SECRETS_BROKER_URL`     broker base URL (trusted operator config).
 *   - `ELIZA_SECRETS_BROKER_TOKEN`   agent-scoped bearer handle. NOT a secret.
 *   - `ELIZA_SECRETS_BROKER_STRICT`  fail-closed: when the broker is configured
 *                                    but unreachable, refuse rather than fall
 *                                    back to a local store that could hold
 *                                    plaintext.
 *
 * Mode is ON only when BOTH url and token are present and non-empty \u2014 the same
 * both-or-nothing rule the model gateway and credential proxy use, so a
 * half-configured broker never silently no-ops into local plaintext storage.
