/**
 * C9 (#8786): multi-agent VOICE_GROUP turn-taking through the Stage-1 pipeline.
 *
 * The existing `voice-group-room.test.ts` exercises the `core.voice_group_address`
 * evaluator in isolation. This drives the REAL `runV5MessageRuntimeStage1` for
 * EACH of several named agents sharing one VOICE_GROUP room, fed the SAME
 * utterance addressed to ONE of them ("Eliza, what's the time?" →
 * addressedTo:["Eliza"]). It asserts the end-to-end outcome the room contract
 * promises:
 *   - the addressed agent (Eliza) reaches a real reply (not terminal IGNORE),
 *   - every un-addressed agent terminates with action === "IGNORE" — driven by
 *     the builtin voice-group address gate inside the live pipeline, not a
 *     hand-rolled evaluator call.
 *
 * Each agent is its own Stage-1 run over its own runtime (an agent only ever
 * processes a turn as itself). Zero LLM spend: the model is a fixture queue that
 * emits the SAME HANDLE_RESPONSE for every agent — only the agent's identity and
 * the gate decide who replies, exactly as in a real room where all agents see
 * the same transcribed utterance.
