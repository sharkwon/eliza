/**
 * Fail-closed delivery gate for the external-content security envelope. The
 * envelope (`wrapExternalContent`) is prompt armor — it must never reach a
 * user, yet a model that echoes its prompt can hand the whole armor block to a
 * callback (live Discord leak 2026-08-02, tj-2dc95f75456876). Detection alone
 * proved insufficient: the tripwire reported the leak after the message
 * shipped. This guard runs at every pre-send seam core owns — the visible
 * callback wrap in `services/message.ts`, the mandatory
 * `outgoing_before_deliver` pipeline phase, and `sendMessageToTarget` — and
 * BLOCKS the send, replacing the text with a short honest notice while
 * `runtime.reportError` carries the clamped original for observability. The
 * MESSAGE_SENT tripwire in basic-capabilities stays as secondary,
 * report-only coverage for deliveries that bypass these seams.
 *
 * Blocking is deliberately variant-tolerant (`containsExternalEnvelopeMaterial`:
 * NFKC-folded, case-insensitive, partial/quoted/reference echoes): a user
 * asking about the marker syntax loses that one reply to the notice, which is
 * the accepted cost of never shipping armor.
 *
 * Streaming coverage: the message-service chunk seam holds a per-stream latch
 * ({@link createOutboundEnvelopeStreamLatch}) that stops chunk forwarding
 * (user stream callback + `model_stream_chunk` hook re-emission) once the
 * accumulated text reads as envelope material, and the first-sentence TTS
 * path refuses to synthesize or attach an envelope echo. KNOWN-OPEN seams:
 * chunks forwarded before the needle completes are already delivered (a
 * stream cannot be recalled), and `useModel`'s own `model_stream_chunk`
 * emission (`source: "use_model"`, runtime.ts) fires upstream of the latch
 * for direct-streaming callers outside the message service. The MESSAGE_SENT
 * tripwire in basic-capabilities is the report-only coverage for whatever
 * escapes those edges.
