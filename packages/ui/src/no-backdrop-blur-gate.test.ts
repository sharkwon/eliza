// anything that moves (the dragged chat sheet, scrolling surfaces). It is the
// single biggest GPU/battery cost in the UI and was removed app-wide. This gate
// fails the build if any backdrop-filter creeps back, so the battery win can't
// silently regress. (To intentionally reintroduce one, you'd remove it here with
// a justification — but the product decision is no blur.)
