/**
 * Default voice + ASR provider selection.
 *
 * Captures the device+mode matrix the product team specified in the
 * settings "advanced mode" picker design:
 *
 *   - Desktop running a local agent → on-device models
 *     (TTS: `local-inference` / OmniVoice, ASR: `local-inference` / Gemma ASR).
 *   - Mobile running a local agent → on-device Kokoro TTS
 *     (TTS: `local-inference`; Kokoro is ~82M params and runs comfortably on
 *     phones — see `selectVoiceBackend({ mobile: true })`). The ASR *provider*
 *     is Eliza Cloud (`eliza-cloud`) because on-device speech recognition is
 *     heavier than TTS — but see the layering note below: on native mobile the
 *     live capture engine is the OS recognizer, not this provider.
 *   - Cloud agents (any device) → free cloud Kokoro TTS
 *     (`eliza-cloud`) for speech, Eliza Cloud (`eliza-cloud`) for ASR.
 *     ElevenLabs is not a default (slow and key-gated); users can still opt
 *     into it from the advanced voice picker.
 *   - Remote-controller surfaces (UI hitting a remote API base) → same as
 *     cloud agents (`eliza-cloud` TTS, Eliza Cloud ASR).
 *
 * The picker is intentionally a pure function so it can be unit-tested
 * exhaustively. The React hook wrapper lives in
 * `hooks/useDefaultProviderPresets.ts`.
 *
 * The ASR side of this matrix is not just a platform guess — it is backed by
 * the measured WER/latency/RTF decision record in `STT_SELECTION.md` (next to
 * this file; #11337): fused eliza-1-asr measured at WER 0.008 / 3.8× realtime
 * on desktop CPU (hence `local-inference` on desktop), while mobile/web stay
 * on `eliza-cloud` until on-device Stage-B numbers justify a flip.
 *
 * Layering caveat (this function is only one of two ASR layers): the `asr`
 * value it returns is the *provider* — the server-side transcription route the
 * settings picker seeds and the server uses when it transcribes. It does NOT
 * pick the interactive-capture engine. That is `resolveBackendKind` in
 * `voice-capture-factory.ts`, which on a native-mobile platform with the
 * TalkMode plugin present unconditionally uses the OS speech recognizer (the
 * only backend that streams interim transcripts, and the one whose assets are
 * actually staged on phones) ahead of any provider preference. So on native
 * mobile the `eliza-cloud` value below governs server-side transcription, not
 * the live on-device capture path — the two layers are chosen independently.
 *
 * On web/desktop the two layers now agree for `eliza-cloud`: the capture
 * factory records a WAV and POSTs it to the cloud STT proxy (`/api/asr/cloud`),
 * so interactive `eliza-cloud` ASR is the real cloud transcriber. Browser
 * SpeechRecognition is used only when WAV capture is unsupported (no
 * `getUserMedia`/`AudioContext`).
 *
 * `pickDefaultVoiceProvider` gives the platform/mode *preference*.
 * `resolveDefaultTtsProvider` (below) turns that preference into a concrete
 * provider against the runtime's actual capabilities — Kokoro on-device when
 * staged, else Kokoro via Eliza Cloud when a session exists, else ElevenLabs
 * (key-gated), else browser SpeechSynthesis — so a default is never pinned to a
 * backend that will fail on the first utterance.
