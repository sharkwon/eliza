 * Canonical lifecycle:
 *   idle → connecting → ready → listening → transcribing → thinking →
 *     speaking → (interrupted | complete) → listening
 *
 * Authority split (binding, from the decision doc §7.4):
 *   - The CLIENT owns `idle`, `connecting`, `listening`, and playback unlock.
 *   - The SERVER is authoritative for `transcribing`, `thinking`, `speaking`,
 *     `interrupted`. Those transitions are driven ONLY by server events, never
 *     synthesized locally.
 *
 * This reducer is pure so the lifecycle is unit-tested without a socket. It maps
 * onto the existing `VoiceContinuousStatus` union (voice-chat-types.ts) rather
 * than forking a second status vocabulary: `toContinuousStatus()` is the single
 * adapter into the unified voice-state surface (#15924).
