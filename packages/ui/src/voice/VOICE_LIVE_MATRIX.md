# Voice Live Matrix

Issue #9958 defines the live-voice verification product surface. This document
is the canonical matrix and `bun run voice:matrix` is the canonical artifact
producer. The matrix is evidence-oriented: every cell is either `pass`, `fail`,
`pending`, or `skip` with a hardware-unavailable reason. A skipped cell is never
platform coverage.

## Dimensions

The full product is:

| Dimension | Values |
| --- | --- |
| platform | `web`, `linux`, `macos-electrobun`, `windows-electrobun`, `ios`, `android` |
| transcription-state | `off`, `on` |
| chime-in | `should-respond`, `should-not-respond` |
| wakeword-context | `idle-wake`, `already-listening-wake-inert`, `mid-transcription-wake` |
| noise/rejection | `quiet`, `noisy-reverberant`, `echo-self-voice`, `overlapping-speech` |
| voices | `owner`, `enrolled-contact`, `unknown`, `multi-speaker` |

The matrix runner records these dimensions per cell rather than expanding every
Cartesian-product row into a separate CI job. The existing Voice Workbench
scenarios cover the multi-row acoustic classes; platform live cells prove the
device boundary.

## Canonical Command

```bash
bun run voice:matrix
```

By default the command probes the current host and writes:

```text
test-results/evidence/9958-voice-matrix/
  voice-matrix.json
  voice-matrix.md
  index.html
```

Use `--run` to execute available cell commands:

```bash
bun run voice:matrix -- --run --platform web
bun run voice:matrix -- --run --platform android
bun run voice:matrix -- --run --platform linux
```

Use `--require-green` on any opted-in hardware lane; it turns `pending` or
`skip` into a failing exit so a readiness variable cannot produce green evidence
while a device, app install, model, or reviewed report is missing.
`--platform` accepts a platform value or exact cell ID; a supplied filter that
matches no cells is a failing configuration and is recorded in
`selection.error`.

To validate the Stage-B STT benchmark cell, point the matrix at the reviewed
report:

```bash
ELIZA_VOICE_STAGE_B_REPORT=test-results/evidence/9958-stage-b/report.json \
  bun run voice:matrix -- --run --platform stt.stage-b.evaluation
```

To validate the real openWakeWord head wake-context cell, point the matrix at the
reviewed report:

```bash
ELIZA_VOICE_OPENWAKEWORD_REPORT=test-results/evidence/9958-openwakeword/report.json \
  bun run voice:matrix -- --run --platform wake.openwakeword.real-head
```

## Hardware Gates

The runner uses environment gates for cells that cannot be proven from a generic
developer laptop:

| Gate | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `ELIZA_VOICE_MACOS_ELECTROBUN_READY=1` | current macOS runner has a built Electrobun app, loopback mic/audio capture, and permission grants |
| `ELIZA_VOICE_WINDOWS_ELECTROBUN_READY=1` | current Windows runner has a built Electrobun app, loopback mic/audio capture, and permission grants |
| `ELIZA_VOICE_DESKTOP_API_BASE` | real app-core API base used by packaged desktop voice self-test; required for macOS/Windows Electrobun live cells |
| `ELIZA_VOICE_IOS_READY=1` | current macOS runner has a booted iOS simulator with the current app build and voice assets installed; the matrix verifies the booted simulator and installed app ID before capture |
| `ELIZA_VOICE_IOS_APP_ID` / `ELIZA_IOS_APP_ID` | optional app ID override for the iOS install check; defaults to `packages/app/app.config.ts` (`ai.elizaos.app`) |
| `ELIZA_VOICE_ANDROID_READY=1` | current runner has an attached Android device/emulator in `device` state, current APK, voice assets, and granted mic permissions; the matrix verifies the attached target and installed app ID before capture |
| `ELIZA_VOICE_ANDROID_APP_ID` / `ELIZA_ANDROID_APP_ID` / `ELIZA_APP_ID` | optional app ID override for the Android install check; defaults to `packages/app/app.config.ts` (`ai.elizaos.app`) |
| `ELIZA_VOICE_OPENWAKEWORD_REPORT` | reviewed openWakeWord real-head JSON report using schema `eliza_voice_openwakeword_eval_v1`; required cases are `idle-wake`, `already-listening-wake-inert`, and `mid-transcription-wake` |
| `ELIZA_INFERENCE_LIBRARY` + `ELIZA_ASR_BUNDLE` | Linux fused real-service runner has the provisioned local-inference bundle |
| `ELIZA_VOICE_STAGE_B_REPORT` | reviewed Stage-B JSON report using schema `eliza_voice_stage_b_stt_eval_v1`; required backends are `ios-sfspeechrecognizer`, `android-speechrecognizer`, and `fused-asr` |

The matrix report records these gates in the `probe.reason` field. This keeps
Linux green separate from missing macOS/iOS/Android evidence.

The openWakeWord report must mark `realHardware: true` and `realHead: true`.
Each required case must identify the device/build/openWakeWord model, record the
real audio source and duration, include manually reviewed artifacts, and prove
the case-specific observation: idle wake opened the listen window, wake while
already listening did not open a duplicate window, and wake during transcription
did not corrupt or drop transcript tokens.

The Stage-B report is intentionally stricter than a plain benchmark dump. Each
backend run must mark `realHardware: true`, identify the build and device, record
latency, `msPerFrame`, true/false accepts, WER, battery or power telemetry, and
list manually reviewed artifact paths.

## TTS Policy

This matrix verifies live voice breadth and Stage-B STT choices. The
web/cloud/remote TTS default decision is owned by the #14370 Railway benchmark
table in `packages/docs/ongoing-development/research/07-voice-pipeline.md` and
implemented in `voice-provider-defaults.ts`; this matrix only proves that the
selected providers work on each platform lane.
