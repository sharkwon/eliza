# STT selection decision — per-device, backed by measured numbers

Issue #11337 (parent #10726, Pillar 3) requires that the STT model/backend
choice per device is **benchmarked and documented**, not just hard-coded. This
file is that decision record. The runtime heuristic that implements it is
`pickDefaultVoiceProvider` in [`voice-provider-defaults.ts`](./voice-provider-defaults.ts)
(plus the capture-time readiness downgrade `isLocalInferenceAsrReady` →
browser fallback in `voice-capture-factory.ts` / `local-asr-transcribe.ts`).

**Two layers, chosen independently.** The `AsrProvider` this table selects is
the *server-side transcription route* (what the settings picker seeds and what
the server uses when it transcribes). It is distinct from the *interactive
capture backend*, which `resolveBackendKind` in `voice-capture-factory.ts`
picks separately: on a native-mobile platform with the TalkMode plugin present
it unconditionally uses the OS speech recognizer (the only backend that streams
interim transcripts, and the one whose assets are staged on phones), ahead of
any provider preference. So the mobile `eliza-cloud` default below is the
server-side route — it is not what runs the live on-device capture.

On web/desktop the two layers now **agree** for `eliza-cloud`: `resolveBackendKind`
routes `eliza-cloud`/`openai` capture to the cloud STT proxy (`/api/asr/cloud`
→ `<cloud-base>/voice/stt`) by recording a WAV and POSTing it, so interactive
web STT is the real cloud transcriber. Browser `SpeechRecognition` is used only
when WAV capture is unsupported (no `getUserMedia`/`AudioContext`).

## Candidate backends

| Backend | What it is | Where it can run |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **fused local ASR** (`local-inference`) | eliza-1-asr GGUF (Qwen3-ASR family, ~1.0 GB main+mmproj) through the fused `libelizainference` FFI | Linux/macOS/Windows desktop, Android (heavy), iOS (heavy) |
| **`SFSpeechRecognizer`** | Apple on-device recognizer (ANE/CPU, `requiresOnDeviceRecognition=true`) | macOS / iOS only (OS engine, not an `AsrProvider` — reachable via the native talkmode bridge) |
| **Android `SpeechRecognizer`** | Android OS recognizer (NNAPI) | Android only (OS engine, not an `AsrProvider` — reachable via the native talkmode bridge) |
| **Browser `SpeechRecognition`** | Web Speech API, engine-dependent (often server-backed) | any browser shell; used **only** when WAV capture is unsupported (no `getUserMedia`/`AudioContext`) |
| **Eliza Cloud ASR** (`eliza-cloud`) | server-side transcription via the cloud API; interactive web capture reaches it through the `/api/asr/cloud` proxy | anywhere with connectivity |

## Measured numbers (committed evidence)

All fused-ASR numbers are real-weight runs — no mocks; lanes fail closed under
their `*_REQUIRE=1` flags.

| Backend | Device | Corpus | WER | Latency / RTF | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| fused eliza-1-asr (bundle-2b) | Linux x86-64, CPU-only | 12 Kokoro utterances, 55.5 s, labelled transcripts | **0.008 mean / 0.000 median** | 1213 ms/utt mean, **RTF 0.262 (3.8× realtime)**, load 1851 ms | ``10726-noise-stt-suites-2026-07-02/stt-quant-bench.md`` (PR #11388, `sttquant:real`) |
| fused eliza-1-asr, noise variants | Linux x86-64, CPU-only | same corpus + white/pink/music/babble at 20…−5 dB SNR | 0.008 clean; ≤ 0.04 at 10 dB (white/pink), 0.039 (babble); collapses only below 0 dB babble | — | ``10726-noise-stt-suites-2026-07-02/noise-rejection.md`` (`noise:real`) |
| fused eliza-1-asr | Linux x86-64, CPU-only | `freeman.wav` (real recorded human speech, 39 words) | accurate (all sentences correct) | 13.1 s for the clip on the current-fork lib | ``10726-host-voice-lanes-linux-2026-07-02.md`` (`test:asr:real`) |
| `SFSpeechRecognizer` (on-device) | Apple silicon (darwin arm64) | 5 labelled utterances, quiet | **0.0 % WER**, 100 % exact-accept | 243 ms mean (p50 80 ms), **RTF 0.168** | ``9958-stt-stage-b-eval/stage-b-stt-eval.md`` (`stage-b-stt-bench.mjs`) |
| `SFSpeechRecognizer` (on-device) | Apple silicon (darwin arm64) | same, white noise at 10 dB SNR | 4.0 % WER, 80 % exact-accept | 352 ms mean, RTF 0.245 | same |
| fused eliza-1-asr | **Pixel 6a (physical device)** | 1 bundled utterance ("what time is it") | WER 0 (single utterance — bring-up proof, not a benchmark) | asr stage 31.3 s **including model load**; steady-state RTF unmeasured | ``10726-android-voice-selftest/README.md`` |
| Android `SpeechRecognizer` (NNAPI) | — | — | **needs-hardware** | needs-hardware | Stage-B gate below |
| Browser `SpeechRecognition` | — | — | engine-dependent, no committed measurement | — | fallback only |
| Eliza Cloud ASR | server-side | — | no committed WER benchmark (network-dependent latency) | — | default where local can't run |

Corpus caveat: the 12-utterance corpus is synthesized with real Kokoro TTS from
fixed transcripts, so absolute WER carries a small TTS-pronunciation floor;
cross-condition/cross-quant deltas are the signal. The freeman.wav row and the
Apple rows are real recorded / OS-synthesized speech.

## Decision (per platform × runtime mode)

| Platform | Runtime | ASR default | Decision + rationale | Matches heuristic? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Desktop (Linux/macOS/Windows) | local / local-only | `local-inference` | **Fused eliza-1-asr wins where provisioned**: measured WER 0.008 at 3.8× realtime on plain desktop CPU, robust to ≥ 10 dB SNR noise, fully offline. No candidate beats it on quality here, and it's the only offline option on Linux/Windows. If the bundle isn't provisioned, `isLocalInferenceAsrReady` degrades capture to the browser engine at runtime. | ✅ yes |
| Mobile (Android/iOS) | local / local-only | `eliza-cloud` | The 1.0 GB fused model **runs** on Android (Pixel 6a WER 0 bring-up) but the only on-device measurement is 31.3 s including load, with steady-state RTF/battery unmeasured — not evidence of a good interactive default. Cloud ASR keeps latency predictable while the on-device Stage-B numbers are missing. Revisit when the Stage-B matrix (below) lands measured on-device RTF/battery. **Provider layer only:** native-mobile *interactive capture* uses the OS TalkMode recognizer regardless (see the two-layers note above); this `eliza-cloud` value is the server-side transcription route. | ✅ yes (provider layer) |
| Web shell | local | `eliza-cloud` | A browser tab hosting a local agent has no fused FFI runtime; the Web Speech API is engine-dependent and unmeasured. Cloud is the deterministic choice. Interactive capture now POSTs the WAV to the cloud STT proxy (`/api/asr/cloud`) instead of the browser recognizer. | ✅ yes |
| any | cloud / remote | `eliza-cloud` | Agent isn't on this machine; audio must go to the server anyway. | ✅ yes |
| macOS/iOS wake-confirm (Stage-B) | — | `SFSpeechRecognizer` | Measured WER 0 quiet / RTF 0.168 on Apple silicon makes it the cheapest-correct confirm recognizer on Apple (VOICE_UX.md §7). This is a talkmode-bridge engine, not an `AsrProvider` value, so it does not change `pickDefaultVoiceProvider`. | n/a (outside the provider enum) |

**Conclusion for #11337 AC "wired back into `pickDefaultVoiceProvider` if the
measured winner differs":** the measured winners do **not** differ from the
platform heuristic — fused local ASR wins on desktop when provisioned (and the
heuristic already prefers it), and no committed measurement justifies flipping
mobile/web away from cloud. No code change required; this doc is the evidence
link the heuristic previously lacked.

**Measurable quality improvements recorded** (parent AC): TTS WER 1.00 → 0.13
(Kokoro double-phonemization fix, PR #11238); STT noise-rejection and quant
benches established the 0.008-WER baseline with pass gates (PR #11388) so any
regression is now measurable.

## How the missing rows get measured (device-gated engines)

The remaining unmeasured cells are OS engines that only exist on provisioned
hardware. They are benchmarked through the **Stage-B** machinery, not ad-hoc
scripts (schema and gates in [`VOICE_LIVE_MATRIX.md`](./VOICE_LIVE_MATRIX.md)):

- **macOS/iOS `SFSpeechRecognizer`** — `node packages/app-core/scripts/voice/stage-b-stt-bench.mjs`
  on a macOS host (cell `stt.stage-b.apple-sfspeech`; Apple-silicon run already
  committed). iOS battery/energy telemetry still needs a real iOS device +
  Instruments.
- **Android `SpeechRecognizer` (NNAPI)** — needs a port of `stage-b-stt-bench`
  to an instrumented Android test on a real device (coordinate with #10727
  device lifecycle and the `voice-live-e2e.yml` runner).
- **Fused ASR on-device (steady-state)** — `bun plugins/plugin-local-inference/native/verify/asr_bench.ts
  --wav-dir <corpus> --real-recorded` on the provisioned device bundle.
- The combined decision cell `stt.stage-b.evaluation` goes green only when
  `packages/app-core/scripts/voice/voice-stage-b-eval.mjs` validates a reviewed
  `eliza_voice_stage_b_stt_eval_v1` report covering `ios-sfspeechrecognizer`,
  `android-speechrecognizer`, and `fused-asr` with real hardware, latency, WER,
  and power telemetry:
  `ELIZA_VOICE_STAGE_B_REPORT=<report.json> bun run voice:matrix -- --run --platform stt.stage-b.evaluation`.

## How to benchmark additional model candidates

`plugins/plugin-local-inference/scripts/stt-quant-bench-real.ts`
(`bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-local-inference sttquant:real`) already accepts
arbitrary extra candidates via env:

- `ELIZA_ASR_QUANT_DIR` — a directory of `eliza-1-asr-<quant>.gguf` files plus a
  shared `eliza-1-asr-mmproj.gguf`; every quant becomes a table row.
- `ELIZA_ASR_BUNDLE` — the shipped bundle layout (`asr/eliza-1-asr.gguf`), the
  row mobile provisioning actually stages.
- `STT_BENCH_MAX_BEST_WER` — sanity ceiling for the best row (default 0.5);
  `STT_BENCH_REQUIRE=1` turns skips into failures.

Only the shipped 2b quant is published on `elizaos/eliza-1` today, so the
committed table has one row; new quants populate it with zero harness changes.
When a new row beats the current default on WER **and** RTF for a device tier,
update the decision table here and (if the winning backend changes) the
heuristic + its unit tests together.
