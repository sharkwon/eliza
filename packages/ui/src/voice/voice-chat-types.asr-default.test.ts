/**
 * Regression coverage for the ASR-provider default in
 * {@link resolveEffectiveVoiceConfig} (voice-live PWA fix).
 *
 * The resolver upgrades the TTS `provider` to `eliza-cloud` when the agent is
 * cloud-connected but no explicit provider was stored. It previously left the
 * ASR side (`asr.provider`) untouched, so a cloud-connected agent whose config
 * carried no explicit ASR provider got a NULL `asr.provider`. `shouldUseCloudAsr`
 * then read `undefined`, the composer mic's `startCloudRecognition` early-returned,
 * and capture fell through to the browser SpeechRecognition path, unavailable in
 * an installed iOS PWA, so the mic did nothing at all ("voice fully cooked").
 *
 * The fix mirrors the TTS cloud-upgrade for ASR: seed `asr.provider =
 * "eliza-cloud"` when cloud is connected and no explicit provider was set, never
 * override an explicit stored provider, and stay undefined when cloud is not
 * connected so the local/desktop defaults keep resolving downstream.
