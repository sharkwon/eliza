/**
 * Canonical glass-surface tokens: the single vocabulary every glassmorphic
 * chrome element draws from. Before this module the shell had ten divergent
 * surface recipes (four blur strengths, five translucent fills, three border
 * idioms — see the fragmentation inventory in
 * `docs/ongoing-development/liquid-glass-unification.md`); a surface
 * now picks a VARIANT here instead of hand-rolling backdrop-filter values.
 *
 * The optical layers themselves (rim ring, sheen, edge shadow, Chromium edge
 * refraction) live in `../components/shell/liquid-glass.tsx` and are
 * re-exported through `./index.ts`; this file only fixes the per-variant
 * numbers. Variants deliberately map 1:1 onto the physical role of a surface,
 * not onto components, so two components sharing a role render identical glass:
 *
 *   sheet   — large panel (chat sheet): heavy blur, NO saturate (saturate over
 *             the warm theme reads brown — measured, not taste), no refraction
 *             (a panel this size would visibly warp text behind it).
 *   card    — small floating card (notification): medium blur + saturate,
 *             refraction-eligible on Chromium, rim ring.
 *   pill    — compact control (composer pill, back-button chip, buttons):
 *             light blur, rim ring, interactive hover lift.
 *   menu    — popover chrome (the + menu, dropdowns, slash menu): same optical
 *             stack as card but a darker fill so hit targets stay legible over
 *             any wallpaper.
 *   banner  — transient toast/banner: card fill at higher opacity, no rim (it
 *             lives for seconds; the ring reads as noise at toast scale).
 *
 * `backdropFilter` values are the CSS tier; native tiers replace the fill +
 * blur with a real system material behind a transparent element (see
 * `useNativeGlass`), keeping ONLY the rim/sheen overlays so the branded edge
 * survives on top of the OS material.
