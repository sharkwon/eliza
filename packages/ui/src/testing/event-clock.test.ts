 * Contract test for the vitest.setup.ts event-clock bridge: under jsdom,
 * `event.timeStamp` must ride the `performance.now()` clock (as it does in
 * real browsers, where both are DOMHighResTimeStamps against timeOrigin)
 * so gesture suites can slow a drag down by mocking `performance.now`.
 * Without the bridge, jsdom stamps events with epoch wall-clock milliseconds,
 * and velocity code that trusts `event.timeStamp` (use-pull-gesture's
 * eventTime) misreads every mock-clocked deliberate drag as a flick.
