/**
 * Destination resolution for the OIDC sign-in bounce. Pure functions, no DOM;
 * the build-time issuer is stubbed with `vi.stubEnv`, the way the other
 * `import.meta.env` consumers in this package are tested.
 *
 * Two properties are under test. `/oidc/continue` can only ever navigate to the
 * origin of the issuer this deployment was configured with — it is reachable by
 * anyone who can link to it, so a caller-influenced destination would make it an
 * open redirect. And a deployment that configured no issuer resolves to NOTHING
 * rather than to a guess: the provider answers only on the host its own issuer
 * names, so a wrong guess produces a resume that reports the user's sign-in as
 * expired and no evidence anywhere of why.
