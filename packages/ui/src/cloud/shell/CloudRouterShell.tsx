/**
 * Top-level react-router shell for the Eliza web app (web build only).
 *
 * This is the single `<BrowserRouter>` that owns the *non-app* routes — the
 * cloud dashboard, public marketing, Steward auth, and token-gated payment /
 * approval pages — and renders the existing tab/view `App` as the catch-all
 * `/*`. The tab/view app's `window.location → tab` behavior is preserved
 * untouched under the catch-all; this shell only adds the parametric routes the
 * backend issues (which a flat tab enum cannot express) and the `/dashboard/*`
 * compat redirects.
 *
 * Route table: every cloud / public / auth / payment route is registered by
 * its domain module via `registerCloudRoute(...)` against the
 * {@link CloudRouteDef} registry; this shell mounts whatever
 * {@link listCloudRoutes} returns and 404s gracefully otherwise.
 *
 * Build-target gating: this module and its Steward / cloud-i18n / query
 * providers are web-build-only. Native (Capacitor) mounts the tab/view App
 * directly with no bundle growth — see `packages/app/src/main.tsx`.
