/**
 * Approvals cloud domain — barrel + route registration.
 *
 * The in-app, owner-facing counterpart to the public token pages
 * (`/approve/:id`, `/ballot/:id`, `/sensitive-requests/:id`). A logged-in owner
 * uses this pane to list and act on their agent's pending approval requests,
 * ballots, and sensitive requests next to chat.
 *
 *  - {@link ApprovalsSurface} is the zero-prop component a settings section /
 *    sidebar host can embed.
 *  - {@link approvalsCloudRoute} is registered **at import time** at
 *    `dashboard/approvals`. This path has no `CloudRouterShell` redirect to
 *    shadow, so eager registration is safe and keeps the standalone deep link
 *    live (same precedent as `dashboard/documents`).
 *    {@link registerApprovalsCloudRoute} is also exported for re-registration at
 *    a custom path if needed.
