/**
 * Cloud = Steward login seam (DECISIONS.md D3).
 *
 * The Cloud connection authenticates via Steward on every target — hosted web
 * (same-origin cookie + localStorage JWT) and native (Bearer-from-localStorage).
 * The actual Steward sign-in UI (passkey / email / OAuth / wallet via
 * `@stwd/react`) lives in the shell-router layer, which lazily mounts the
 * Steward provider only when the user chooses Cloud. This module is the thin,
 * dependency-free contract between the two:
 *
 *   - The shell-router registers a launcher with {@link registerStewardLoginLauncher}.
 *   - The cloud-state login flow (the interactive Cloud branch) calls
 *     {@link launchStewardLogin}, which resolves once a Steward session token is
 *     present (or rejects on cancel / failure).
 *
 * Keeping this a plain module (no React, no `@stwd/*`) means `useCloudState`
 * never pulls the Steward SDK into the non-cloud bundle — the SDK ships only in
 * the shell-router's lazy cloud path.
