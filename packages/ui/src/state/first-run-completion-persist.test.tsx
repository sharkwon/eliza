/**
 * Client-side durability contract for onboarding completion (issue #11506).
 *
 * Symptom: after finishing onboarding, a fresh app process (mobile relaunch /
 * desktop restart) re-showed onboarding. The client's completion signal is an
 * in-memory React ref (`firstRunCompletionCommittedRef`) that is lost on every
 * process restart, so a fresh boot depended entirely on the server status —
 * and re-prompted whenever that status was briefly unavailable or lagged.
 *
 * These tests drive the REAL persistence + coordinator functions (no mock
 * stands in for the thing under test) and assert the SEMANTIC outcome: a
 * completed onboarding, persisted durably, keeps the completion committed
 * across a simulated fresh process and routes the boot home instead of
 * returning `first-run-required`.
