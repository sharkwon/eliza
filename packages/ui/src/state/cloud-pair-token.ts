/**
 * Delete channel for the durable cloud-pair API token (#16666).
 *
 * `persistCloudPairApiToken` (CloudPairRelay) writes the key into BOTH
 * sessionStorage and localStorage so an installed PWA survives relaunch; boot
 * adoption (packages/app main.tsx) then re-adopts whatever it finds on every
 * launch. Until this module existed there was no remover anywhere, so a
 * rotated/revoked agent credential was re-adopted forever. Kept as its own
 * module (not folded into the persistence grab-bag) because future explicit
 * flows — sign-out, unpair, agent deletion — need the same clear.
 *
 * `clearStalePairCredentialsForAgent` is the only purge callers should reach
 * for: it demands a target agent and clears nothing unless the persisted state
 * actually belongs to that agent. The raw `clearCloudPairApiToken` stays
 * exported for the explicit-flow clears above.
