# Agent Surface

The unified layer that makes every plugin **view** fully controllable by the
agent through the floating pill (voice/text) — so views never ship their own
chat surface. Every interactive element opts in once and becomes addressable,
focus-aware, fillable, clickable, and visible to the agent.

## How it fits together

```
DynamicViewLoader (host)
 └─ AgentSurfaceProvider viewId/viewType         ← owns one ViewAgentRegistry
     ├─ <YourView/>  ── useAgentElement(...) ────► registers elements
     └─ AgentElementOverlay                       ← draws indicators on highlight
                         ▲
   view-interact handler ┘  POST /api/views/:id/interact → WS → here
       routes agent-surface capabilities to handleAgentSurfaceCapability(registry, …)
```

The provider + overlay are mounted by `DynamicViewLoader` for **every** view, so
a view only has to call `useAgentElement`. `@elizaos/ui` and `react` are
externalised in the view bundle (see `packages/scripts/view-bundle-vite.config.ts`),
so the hook resolves to the host singleton and shares the loader's React context.

## Capabilities (handled generically for any view)

| capability        | params              | result                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `list-elements`   | `{role?, group?}`   | filtered `AgentElementSnapshot[]`        |
| `describe-element`| `{id}`              | one `AgentElementSnapshot`               |
| `get-focus`       | —                   | `{focusedId, element}`                   |
| `get-agent-state` | —                   | full `AgentSurfaceSnapshot`              |
| `agent-click`     | `{id}`              | `{ok, reason?}`                          |
| `agent-fill`      | `{id, value}`       | `{ok, value?, reason?}`                  |
| `agent-focus`     | `{id}`              | `{ok}`                                   |
| `agent-scroll-to` | `{id}`              | `{ok}`                                   |
| `set-highlight`   | `{on}`              | `{highlighting}`                         |

### Standard view-interact caps

Alongside the agent-surface caps above, every view accepts the protocol's
standard caps — `get-state`, `refresh`, `focus-element`, `get-text`,
`click-element`, `fill-input` (`STANDARD_CAPABILITIES` in
`packages/ui/src/views/view-interact-protocol.ts`). `get-state` returns the
registry snapshot when elements are registered; `focus-element` /
`click-element` / `fill-input` accept `{agentId}` and route through the registry.

The interact route's bypass allowlist
(`STANDARD_CAPABILITY_IDS` in `packages/agent/src/api/views-routes.ts`) is the
**union** of these two sets — `AGENT_SURFACE_CAPABILITY_IDS` ∪
`STANDARD_CAPABILITIES` — derived directly from these canonical sources, so a
view with its own declared `capabilities` allowlist still accepts every cap the
shell dispatches generically. Edit the ids in the two source files; the route
follows.

## Converting a view

```tsx
import { useAgentElement } from "@elizaos/ui";

function RefreshButton({ onClick }: { onClick: () => void }) {
  const { ref, agentProps } = useAgentElement<HTMLButtonElement>({
    id: "action-refresh",          // stable, unique within the view
    role: "button",
    label: "Refresh",              // what the user would say to target it
    group: "toolbar",
    description: "Reload the data",
  });
  return <button ref={ref} {...agentProps} onClick={onClick} aria-label="Refresh">⟳</button>;
}
```

Rules:

- **One element, one stable id.** Ids are the agent's address space — keep them
  semantic (`tab-positions`, `input-amount`, `action-send`).
- **Hooks can't run in `.map()`** — extract a tiny child component that calls
  `useAgentElement` (see `WalletRailTabButton` in `plugin-wallet`).
- **Roles** drive fill/click affordances:
  `FILLABLE_ROLES` = text-input, number-input, textarea, select, slider;
  `CLICKABLE_ROLES` = button, link, toggle, tab, menu-item, list-item, card.
- **Controlled components** pass `onFill` / `onActivate` so the registry drives
  React state instead of the DOM; uncontrolled native fields work automatically.
- **Tabs/segments**: role `tab`, `status: active ? "active" : "inactive"`, and an
  `aria-current` — the `data-state` also counts as a visual indicator in the
  view audit.
- **Selects/choice pickers**: pass `options` to whitelist valid fill values.
- Don't add a `capabilities` array to `plugin.ts` — the verbs above are universal.

`AgentButton`, `AgentInput`, and `IconTag` are ready-made wrappers for the
common cases.

## Server-side weighting

`packages/agent/src/runtime/view-action-affinity.ts` keeps the active view's
scoped actions at full parameter detail in the planner prompt (set by
`POST /api/views/:id/navigate`), so the agent can act on whatever the user is
looking at even with no intent keyword.

## Canonical reachability contract (#8798)

Every interactive control in a view must be reachable by the agent through
**exactly one** of three layers — and the audit (`validateViewCoverage` in
`view-action-affinity.ts`, the per-view e2e harness) enforces that none is left
unreachable:

1. **Universal agent-surface element** (`useAgentElement`) — the default, and the
   right answer for any clickable/fillable control. Do **not** add a
   `capabilities` array for these; the verbs (`list-elements`, `agent-click`,
   `agent-fill`, …) are universal.
2. **Declared `ViewCapability` + handler** — only for view-specific *compound*
   operations that can't be expressed as a single click/fill (e.g.
   `terminal-list-views`). Dispatched via `POST /api/views/:id/interact`.
3. **Runtime action in `VIEW_ACTION_MAP`** — domain actions the agent runs
   directly (e.g. `wallet → EVM_SWAP`); these get full-param weighting while the
   view is foreground.

**Standard capability sets, reconciled.** Two legacy "standard capability" lists
exist: `views/view-interact-protocol.ts` `STANDARD_CAPABILITIES`
(`get-state`, `refresh`, `focus-element`, `get-text`) and
`AGENT_SURFACE_CAPABILITY_IDS` (`list-elements`, `agent-click`, …). The
**agent-surface set is canonical** for element-level control; the legacy set is a
thin compatibility alias that still routes through the same registry
(`view-interact-registry.ts`). New views should rely on the agent-surface verbs;
the legacy ids remain only for the few callers that predate the registry.

**`serverInteract` (kept, not dead).** `ViewDeclaration.serverInteract` lets a
view answer a `ViewCapability` *without a mounted frontend* (the route in
`views-routes.ts` calls it before any WS round-trip). It is a live extension
point for headless/connector-driven capabilities; for ordinary in-view controls
prefer the universal agent-surface (layer 1).
