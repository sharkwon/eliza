/**
 * Source-scanning gate enforcing the views-redesign de-chipping (#13588): views
 * carry designed empty states, never in-view suggestion chips or "create-X"
 * marketing CTAs. The agent suggests in chat (per-view proactive greeting
 * #13587) instead. Reads the src tree, no runtime — mirrors
 * `no-widget-chrome-gate.test.ts` so the decision can't silently regress.
 *
 * Two bans: (1) the deleted `ChatEmptyStateWithRecommendations` component may not
 * reappear as an import/JSX/type, and (2) the specific chat-prefill chip and
 * empty-state marketing strings its consumers rendered may not reappear. The
 * ban is on suggestions and marketing, NOT on genuinely functional controls
 * (real create forms, upload intake, backup/restore) — those keep their labels.
