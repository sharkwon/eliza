/**
 * Infinite upward scroll for a chat transcript (#13532, epic #13539).
 *
 * Companion to {@link useThreadAutoScroll} (which owns bottom-follow). This
 * hook owns the OTHER direction: as the reader scrolls
 * toward older messages it asynchronously fetches + prepends a page, and it
 * does so WITHOUT a visible jump — the message that was at the top before the
 * prepend stays visually put.
 *
 * Three responsibilities, all here so prefetch + preservation live in one place
 * rather than being duplicated across ChatView / InboxChatPanel / the overlay:
 *
 *  1. **Trigger before the literal top.** A top sentinel + IntersectionObserver
 *     (with a positive `rootMargin`) fires the load a viewport-fraction BEFORE
 *     the reader reaches the very first line, so the older page is usually
 *     already prepended by the time they get there — no "wall then wait".
 *
 *  2. **In-flight guard.** A ref gates concurrent scroll-ups so a fast flick
 *     (or the sentinel re-intersecting mid-fetch) can't double-fetch the same
 *     page. `hasMore=false` latches the loader off entirely.
 *
 *  3. **Scroll-anchor preservation.** Older content grows the scroller UPWARD,
 *     which would shove the reader's viewport down by the grown height. We
 *     capture `scrollHeight` immediately before requesting the grow and, in a
 *     layout effect after the DOM has grown, add the height delta back to
 *     `scrollTop`. Net viewport motion: zero.
 *
 * It is scroll math + fetch orchestration only — the caller owns the state
 * (passes `onLoadOlder`, `hasMore`, and a `topItemKey` that changes when the
 * thread's FIRST item changes so the preservation effect knows a prepend
 * landed). The caller wires `sentinelRef` above the first message row and
 * shares the SAME scroller node with `useThreadAutoScroll` via `scrollRef`.

  // `topItemKey` is ALSO an intentional dependency (#13953): callers render the

  // of a conversation the first effect run sees `sentinelRef.current === null`
  // and bails without observing. Messages then land asynchronously and mount
  // the sentinel — but mutating a ref never re-runs an effect, and none of the
  // other deps are guaranteed to change on the empty→populated transition, so
  // without this dep the observer would never attach and scroll-up load-older
  // would be silently dead. `topItemKey` changes exactly when the first item
  // changes (empty→populated, conversation switch, prepend), so it doubles as
  // the "sentinel (re)mounted" signal: the effect re-runs, sees the mounted
  // sentinel, and subscribes. It also tears down + re-binds across a
  // conversation switch that transiently clears the thread to [] — the old
  // (now detached) sentinel is dropped instead of being observed forever. A
  // re-subscribe after an ordinary prepend is cheap (disconnect + observe) and
  // an immediately-intersecting sentinel just continues paging, which the
