/**
 * Lightweight settings-section token map — no React/component imports, so the
 * always-mounted chat composer can resolve `/settings <section>` without
 * pulling in the heavy section component graph from `settings-sections.ts`.
 *
 * The token map is DERIVED from the section registry rather than hand-written:
 *   - built-in tokens come from `SETTINGS_SECTION_META` (id + declared aliases),
 *     the single source of truth for built-in ids/labels/grouping, and
 *   - plugin/host sections registered via `registerSettingsSection` are resolved
 *     live from the registry, so a section added at boot is reachable by its id
 *     and declared aliases without a central edit here.
 *
 * `LEGACY_SETTINGS_SECTION_TOKEN_ALIASES` remains only as a covered fallback for
 * tokens that are not (yet) owned by a section's `aliases` declaration; a drift
 * test asserts every legacy token still resolves and that the derived map has
 * not silently lost a built-in id.
