/**
 * Launcher curation — the single source of truth for what shows in the app
 * launcher.
 *
 * The launcher renders ONE page of view tiles (the home dashboard is the
 * adjacent page). Ordering: the everyday curated apps first, then developer
 * tools (only when Developer Mode is on), then any other loaded plugin app,
 * then — on the AOSP ElizaOS fork — the native-OS tiles.
 *
 * Visibility follows the view-kind taxonomy (`@elizaos/core`): `system` +
 * `release` always show; `developer` and `preview` are hidden by default and
 * appear only when their Settings toggle is on (both default off on every
 * build, dev included, so users and developers see the same launcher out of the
 * box). The curated developer TOOLS (trajectory viewer, database, runtime,
 * logs, skills, plugins) are treated as developer-kind regardless of how each is
 * declared, so the whole set hides together in production.
 *
 * Curation is a blocklist + canonical dedup, not a fixed allow-list: known apps
 * are ordered, removed apps are hidden, grouped sub-pages collapse under their
 * parent tile, duplicate registrations collapse to one tile, and everything else
 * that is genuinely loaded and visible still appears so installing a new plugin
 * app keeps working. Native-OS tiles (phone/messages/contacts/camera/files) only
 * appear on the AOSP ElizaOS fork.
