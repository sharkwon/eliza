/**
 * Lifecycle registry for renderer-side background services — long-lived,
 * non-React work (pollers, native listeners, capture loops) that plugins start
 * in the browser renderer and that must be stopped again, never orphaned.
 *
 * Two halves meet here. Plugin side-effect registration entries (the
 * `elizaos.appRegister` modules the app shell imports after first paint) call
 * `registerRendererService` with a scoped definition instead of starting work
 * at import time. The app shell calls `startRendererServiceHost` exactly once
 * per renderer window with the window's resolved shell kind; the host starts
 * every eligible definition, retains the cleanup each `start` returns, and
 * invokes it on page teardown (`pagehide`), on host replacement, and when a
 * definition re-registers under the same id (dev HMR re-evaluating a plugin
 * registration module). Registration and host startup are order-independent:
 * definitions registered before the host exists start when it arrives, and
 * definitions registered later (side-effect modules load on the idle path)
 * start immediately.
 *
 * The store lives on `globalThis` so duplicated module evaluations (HMR, mixed
 * chunk graphs) share one registry — two copies of this module must never each
 * believe they own the running instances. Stop is race-safe against pending
 * starts: stopping while `start` is still awaited marks the instance stopped,
 * and the settled start's cleanup runs immediately instead of leaking. A
 * `start` that resolves without a cleanup function is a contract violation and
 * is reported as a failure — silently discarded disposers are exactly the bug
 * this module exists to prevent (#16504).

// plugin registration chunk and the app shell chunk can each bundle their own
// copy (mixed chunk graphs). A module-local store forks per evaluation, which
// is precisely the double-ownership bug this exists to prevent. Routing
// through the app's loader-identity cache instead was rejected because it
// inverts the dependency direction (#12091: packages/ui must not reach into
// packages/app machinery) and would leave non-app hosts (tests, storybook-like
