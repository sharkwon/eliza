 * Config for the `test/app/*.{real,live}.e2e.test.ts` browser-driven real e2e
 * suite (qa-checklist, memory-relationships,
 * streaming-visible-text). These drive a real renderer via puppeteer/playwright
 * against a real app-core runtime + a real model provider; each self-skips
 * (`describeIf`/CAN_RUN) unless `ELIZA_LIVE_TEST=1` + a provider is present.
 *
 * The default `vitest.config.ts` explicitly EXCLUDES these files and only scans
 * `src/`, and `vitest.e2e.config.ts` only includes `src/**`, so before this
 * config nothing ran them — they were dark. Invoke via the `test:app-real-e2e`
 * script; wired into the nightly real lane.
