/**
 * Node/runtime barrel for `@elizaos/app-core` (the `.` export): re-exports the
 * dashboard HTTP API plus auth/response helpers, the Eliza runtime loader and
 * runtime-mode/desktop surfaces, the curated registry, security/vault/steward
 * services, first-run config, and diagnostics. Frontend surfaces live in
 * `@elizaos/ui`; pure contracts/utilities live in `@elizaos/shared`. Star
 * re-exports are used except where a name collides with `@elizaos/ui`
 * (`ConfigField`/`getPlugins`, re-exported explicitly); `./platform/empty-node-module`
 * is deliberately excluded so its browser aliases can't shadow the real Node
 * exports.
