/**
 * Fresh-install boot deferral for the server-only startup path: the gate that
 * decides "this process is a genuinely-fresh install awaiting onboarding" and
 * the single-flight registry that boots the agent runtime once onboarding
 * commits.
 *
 * On a fresh install the GUI shows onboarding first, and the default runtime
 * a server-only boot would build (PGlite open, migrations, plugin-sql, default
 * character, services) is discarded the moment onboarding persists a real
 * configuration. `startEliza` (runtime/eliza.ts) therefore consults
 * `shouldDeferRuntimeBootUntilOnboarding()` right before its post-bind runtime
 * boot and, when it defers, registers the boot closure here instead. The boot
 * then fires from exactly one of: the first-run commit handler
 * (`POST /api/first-run`, first-run-routes.ts) or an explicit
 * `POST /api/agent/start` / `POST /api/agent/restart` (both funnel through the
 * server's `onRestart`). All triggers share one in-flight promise so
 * concurrent requests can never double-open the PGlite data dir.
 *
 * The gate must be exactly "the GUI will show onboarding": it reuses
 * `hasCompatPersistedFirstRunState` — the predicate `GET /api/first-run/status`
 * answers `complete` with — plus the cloud-provisioned and provider-env
 * short-circuits, so env-configured contexts (CI with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
 * `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` dev loops, provisioned containers) keep booting the
 * runtime immediately, exactly as before.
