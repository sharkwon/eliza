/**
 * Password hashing + strength gating for the P1 auth path.
 *
 * Backed by `@node-rs/argon2` per plan §11 (Rust prebuilt binaries, no
 * native compile step on Bun/Linux CI). We use argon2id with parameters
 * lifted from current OWASP Password Storage guidance:
 *
 *   memoryCost: 19_456 KiB (≈19 MiB)
 *   timeCost:   2 iterations
 *   parallelism: 1
 *
 * The native module is loaded only when a password operation runs so API
 * startup and unauthenticated health checks do not depend on native-library
 * initialization. `verifyPassword` delegates to its timing-safe `verify`;
 * every verification runs through the full KDF.
 *
 * Hard rule: this module fails closed. Any error during `hash` or `verify`
 * propagates to the caller. We do NOT swallow exceptions and pretend the
 * password matched.
