/**
 * Collect the third-party (non-@elizaos) runtime dependency closure for the
 * agent Docker image.
 *
 * Background: the CI image (deploy/Dockerfile.ci) ships pre-transpiled
 * artifacts and links a fixed set of workspace packages into
 * /app/node_modules (see link-docker-local-app-packages.mjs). Some of those
 * packages are transpiled (tsc, not bundled), so their bare third-party imports
 * stay external and must resolve from node_modules at runtime; others are
 * bundled with a small third-partys list. The image used to install a
 * hand-maintained allowlist of those third-partys, which had to be extended by
 * hand every time a newly-linked package pulled in a new dependency, causing
 * repeated boot-crash / rebuild loops.
 *
 * This script replaces that hand-maintained list with a DERIVED one: it reads
 * the declared `dependencies` of every workspace package that is linked into
 * the image, drops the workspace (@elizaos/*) entries (those are linked
 * separately, not installed from the registry), and emits the union as
 * `name@version` install specifiers. `npm install` then resolves the full
 * transitive closure automatically.
 *
 * Versions: each dependency is pinned to the exact version the workspace
 * lockfile resolves (bun.lock), falling back to the declared range when the
 * lockfile cannot be read. This keeps the image build reproducible.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node collect-docker-runtime-deps.mjs            # prints `name@version`, one per line
 *   node collect-docker-runtime-deps.mjs --json     # prints a JSON array
 *   node collect-docker-runtime-deps.mjs --names    # prints bare names, one per line
 *                                                   # (for pre-clean rm -rf)
 *
 * The set of linked packages MUST stay in sync with the `localPackages`
 * array in link-docker-local-app-packages.mjs. It is duplicated here (rather
 * than imported) because that module performs filesystem linking as a side
 * effect at import time.
