# TEE-Native Agent Implementation Plan — Confidential AI End to End

Date: 2026-05-21
Lane: AGENT-RUNTIME (confidential agent + confidential inference)
Status: **Phase A landed (software-only).** The agent-side primitives, the
production boot-gate wiring, the production profile, the nonce/`report_data`
replay binding, the signed revocation manifest, and the confidential-inference
unseal *plumbing* (against the local mock KMS) are built and unit-tested — see
the Phase A table in §7 and the DONE markers in §1.2. **All real hardware quote
verification (real TDX/CoVE quote signature, RTMR, and `report_data` validation;
the dstack guest agent; RA-TLS KMS) is Phase B/C and stays BLOCKED on hardware**
— called out as such throughout. **The agent runs on a CPU-based Intel TDX CVM;
confidential-GPU (NVIDIA H100) is out of scope.** Phase A verifies a signed
evidence *document* and fails closed; it does not claim hardware-verified trust.

Scope discipline (repo `AGENTS.md`): this document is the plan only. It does
not refactor production code. It proposes strongly-typed additions (no `any`,
no silent fallbacks) and fail-closed gates. Nothing here invents product
behavior beyond the documented local-first + optional-Cloud topology.

## 0. What the device must guarantee

A TEE-native ultra-private personal AI device. The agent runtime, model
weights, KV-cache, user data, signing keys, and the local inference engine all
run inside a single-tenant whole-system confidential domain (a dstack CVM on
TDX today; a CoVE/TSM TVM on the E1 chip later). Cleartext weights, prompts,
embeddings, and KV-cache never exist outside that domain. Secrets are released
only after a fresh, nonce-bound attestation proves the measured agent + policy
+ container + NPU firmware match the release manifest, debug is disabled, and
the security version is above the rollback floor. Up to a 10% perf hit is
acceptable for this guarantee.

---

## 1. Critical assessment of the existing `tee-*` suite

### 1.1 What is real, strong, and load-bearing

The normalized evidence type and the policy verifier are the genuine core, and
they are good:

- **`tee-evidence.ts`** — `TeeEvidence` is a clean, provider-neutral normalized
  shape (`kind`, `provider`, `securityVersion`, `measurements`, `freshness`,
  `claims`, `quote`, `certificatePem`, `reportData`, `raw`). `normalizeTeeEvidence`
  is strict and fail-closed: it throws on non-objects, non-string measurements,
  non-boolean claims, non-integer `securityVersion`, and a missing `kind`. No
  `any`; the only `unknown` is at the deserialization boundary, which is correct.
  `normalizeDigest` canonicalizes the `sha256:` prefix and case. `teeMeasurementDigestMatches`
  treats an *expected* digest as required and a *missing actual* as a failure —
  the right default. **Real.**
- **`tee-policy.ts`** — `evaluateTeeEvidencePolicy` is the single trust decision
  function and it is comprehensive: kind/provider allowlists, required and
  revoked measurements, min/revoked security version, nonce match, timestamp
  freshness window (with a 60s forward-skew clamp), and required boolean claims.
  Decisions are a closed discriminated union of `reason` strings. Fail-closed:
  required-but-missing → `missing-evidence`. **Real and the centerpiece.**
- **`tee-revocation.ts`** — schema-versioned revocation manifest (measurements +
  security versions), normalizes string/number/object entries, dedupes, merges
  into a policy. Clean. **Real.**
- **`tee-release-policy.ts`** — derives a `TeeEvidencePolicy` from an OS release
  manifest (`tee.enabled/providers/measurements/requiredClaims/minSecurityVersion`).
  Maps the OS measured-boot contract into the agent's policy. **Real.**
- **`tee-runtime-config.ts`** — env-driven policy resolution
  (`ELIZA_TEE_POLICY_JSON/_PATH`, `ELIZA_TEE_RELEASE_MANIFEST_JSON/_PATH`,
  `ELIZA_TEE_REVOCATIONS_JSON/_PATH`, `ELIZA_TEE_REQUIRED`, nonce/max-age). **Real.**
- **`tee-signer-backend.ts`** — `TeeSignerBackend` decorates a `SignerBackend` and
  re-collects + re-evaluates evidence before *every* `signMessage`/`signTransaction`.
  Fail-closed by construction; the test proves the inner signer is never called on
  a failed decision. **Real.**
- **`remote-capability-endpoint-provider.ts`** — `connectRemoteCapabilityEndpointProvider`
  collects endpoint TEE evidence at provision time and `evaluateProvisionedEndpointTeeTrust`
  **throws before `syncRemoteCapabilityPlugins`** when the policy fails. The test
  proves no plugin is registered on a missing/mismatched-measurement endpoint.
  This is the strongest integration point in the suite. **Real.**
- Tests: `tee-policy.test.ts`, `tee-key-release.test.ts`, `tee-signer-backend.test.ts`,
  `tee-revocation.test.ts`, `tee-release-policy.test.ts`, `tee-runtime-config.test.ts`,
  `tee-evidence-provider.test.ts`, and `remote-capability-tee-policy.test.ts`
  cover the positive and critical negative paths. `tee-full-stack-local.ts`
  exercises policy → key-release end to end against a mock KMS and writes a JSON
  evidence artifact. Concrete evidence collection belongs to a deployment plugin.

### 1.2 What is mock, stubbed, or thin — be specific

> **Status reconciliation (Phase A landed).** Several gaps called out below have
> since been closed in software (Phase A — no hardware required) and are marked
> **DONE** inline with the implementing file. What remains genuinely blocked is
> **real hardware quote verification** (TDX signature / RTMR / `report_data`
> validation, the dstack guest agent, RA-TLS KMS) — Phase B/C, **BLOCKED on CPU
> TDX hardware**. Confidential-GPU (H100) is **out of scope** (CPU TDX CVM only).
> The software items below do **not** make the
> system hardware-trusted; they verify a signed evidence *document* and fail
> closed when it is absent, simulated, replayed, or tampered.

- **No concrete quote verifier ships in this package.** The
  `tee-evidence-provider.ts` registration seam accepts a deployment plugin's
  provider, while `normalizeTeeEvidence` validates its normalized document. The
  agent package never parses a TDX quote, never
  checks an Intel PCS/QvL signature, never validates RTMRs against `report_data`,
  never verifies the DICE/RA-TLS cert chain. **`evidence.quote` is carried but
  never cryptographically verified.** The policy verifier trusts whatever the
  provider hands it. This is the single biggest gap: today the system verifies a
  *self-asserted JSON document*, not a hardware attestation. This is acceptable
  for the macOS-feasible lane and unit tests, but it is **not** the security
  property the product claims, and the codebase does not currently hide that —
  it just hasn't built the verifier. (Honest gap, not slop.)
- **DONE (A7) — nonce + `report_data` replay binding.** `tee-key-release.ts` now
  generates a fresh ephemeral X25519 keypair and a fresh nonce per request and
  binds `report_data = SHA256(nonce || epk_pub)` (`TeeReportDataChallenge`,
  `collectEvidenceWithReportData`). The issued nonce is set as `policy.expectedNonce`
  so `evaluateTeeEvidencePolicy` rejects `nonce-mismatch`, closing the replay gap
  for a passive collector. (Originally: the client sent whatever nonce was already
  in the evidence — replayable.) The crypto binding is real; **the quote that
  carries `report_data` is still not hardware-verified — Phase B2, BLOCKED.**
- **`LocalTeeKeyReleaseClient` is an HMAC KDF, not a KMS.** It derives key
  material with `HMAC-SHA256(masterSecret, keyId|context|agent|policy|device)`.
  This is a faithful *model* of "deterministic app-key bound to measurement" and
  it correctly varies output per agent/policy measurement (proven by test), but
  the `masterSecret` lives in agent memory. It is a local-dev stand-in for the
  dstack decentralized KMS, not the KMS.
- **DONE (A4) — production boot-gate wiring.** `runtime/eliza.ts` now runs
  `runTeeBootGate` at startup: it calls `evaluateTeeBootGate` (which resolves the
  runtime policy, merges the production profile, collects evidence, and evaluates
  trust ONCE), fails closed on any error, and publishes the decision via
  `setTeeBootGateState`. Secret-bearing paths consult `teeBootGateBlocksSecrets()`
  (`tee-boot-gate-state.ts`), and `assertTeeBootGateAllowsSecrets` throws
  fail-closed when secrets are disabled. `ELIZA_TEE_REQUIRED=true` with no trusted
  evidence ⇒ no model-key release, no signing, no remote-plugin sync; degraded
  boot allowed, silent secret release never. (Originally: `tee-*` was only
  `export *`-ed with no boot consumer.)
- **DONE (A8) — confidential-inference unseal plumbing.**
  `tee-confidential-inference.ts` releases the `model-key` (`MODEL_KEY_ID`) only
  after the key-release client's evidence satisfies the policy, then decrypts the
  at-rest weights blob in process memory and hands it to the local runtime. The
  test asserts the weights and key never touch disk, env, or the structured
  logger, and that tampered/absent evidence makes the key unavailable so unseal
  throws (negative path enforced by data unavailability). (Originally: no unseal
  path, `model-key` had no consumer.) This runs against the **local HMAC KDF /
  mock KMS** — the **real RA-TLS KMS and real quote verification are Phase B,
  BLOCKED.**
- **DONE (A3/A6) — centralized production profile rejecting DevMode/simulated
  evidence.** `tee-production-profile.ts` (`mergeTeeProductionProfile`) forces
  `required`, `requiredClaims` (`debugDisabled`/`productionLifecycle`), and
  `rejectSimulatedEvidence` on, so a caller cannot accept DevMode evidence by
  forgetting a claim. `evaluateTeeEvidencePolicy` rejects evidence that
  self-identifies as mock/simulated/debug/devmode (kind, hardwareVendor, provider,
  quote markers, verifier) — the `tee-production-profile.test.ts` matrix proves
  it. This is an agent-side compensating control against dstack #608 (DevMode
  allow-all); it does **not** replace **real quote-signature verification —
  Phase B2, BLOCKED.** KMS-identity pinning / RA-TLS cert verification config
  fields exist (A6) but the live RA-TLS handshake is Phase B.
- **Two `Tee*` type homes.** `packages/core/src/types/tee.ts` defines a *legacy*
  `TeeAgent`/`RemoteAttestationQuote`/`TEEMode`/`TeeType` set (old plugin-tee
  shape). The *new* canonical types live in `packages/agent/src/services/tee-evidence.ts`.
  These do not conflict (different concepts) but the naming overlap is a trap.
  Plan: leave core's legacy types alone unless a consumer needs them; treat
  `tee-evidence.ts` as the single source of truth for confidential-AI evidence
  and document that in core's file.

### 1.3 Contracts that already exist (and we must not redefine)

- The normalized `TeeEvidence` shape and `evaluateTeeEvidencePolicy` decision
  union are the cross-layer contract. The chip lane (`06-os-on-tee-software.md`)
  and OS lane (`tee-measured-boot-contract.md`) both explicitly anchor to them
  and promise *not* to fork them. Keep it that way.
- Measurement names: `boot`, `os`, `agent`, `policy`, `device`, `container`,
  `compose`, `npuFirmware`, `gpuFirmware` (+ open string). Claims: `debugDisabled`,
  `productionLifecycle`, `secureBoot`, `memoryEncrypted`, `ioProtected`,
  `gpuProtected`, `npuProtected`.

**Verdict:** the policy/evidence/revocation core is production-grade and the
right design. The verifier of *real* quotes, the *nonce/epk binding*, the
*confidential-inference unseal path*, the *production hardening profile*, and
the *boot wiring* are the missing pieces. The work is integration + a real
verifier, not a rebuild.

## 2. Confidential AI inference path (the headline)

### 2.1 Goal

Model weights are encrypted at rest on the device's storage. They are decrypted
only inside the confidential domain, only after attestation-gated release of the
`model-key`, and loaded directly into the in-domain local model runtime (eliza-1)
and the NPU. Prompts, embeddings, KV-cache, and generated tokens live only in
private (memory-encrypted) pages and never cross to a non-measured device in
cleartext.

### 2.2 Weights-at-rest + unseal flow (local-in-TEE)

```text
1. Boot the confidential domain (dstack CVM / CoVE TVM).
   OS/silicon lane produces the measured-launch quote.
2. In-domain attestation agent assembles TeeEvidence (kind, measurements
   incl. agent+policy+container+npuFirmware, claims, freshness).
3. Agent boot resolves the production TeeEvidencePolicy
   (resolveTeeRuntimePolicy + production profile, §4.2).
4. Agent requests model-key from KMS:
     - generate ephemeral X25519 keypair (epk) in-domain
     - obtain a fresh verifier nonce
     - bind reportData = SHA256(nonce || epk_pub) into the quote
     - send {keyId:"model-key", evidence, policy} over RA-TLS
5. KMS verifies the quote (RTMRs/measurements, signature, freshness, policy),
   derives the app-deterministic model-key, wraps it to epk, returns it.
6. Agent unwraps model-key in-domain, decrypts the weights blob
   (AES-256-GCM / XChaCha20-Poly1305) into private memory.
7. Weights stream into the local model runtime (eliza-1) and the NPU
   private queues. The model-key and cleartext weights never leave the domain.
8. Inference: prompts/embeddings/KV-cache stay in private pages. Output crosses
   to the UI only through the explicit shared-page copy path.
```

If step 5 fails (tampered agent/OS/policy → measurement-mismatch, stale quote,
debug enabled, rolled-back version), the KMS withholds `model-key`, the weights
stay ciphertext, and **inference is impossible** — the negative path is enforced
by *data unavailability*, not by a software check that could be patched out.
This is the property called out in chip §3.4 and it is the design we adopt.

### 2.3 KV-cache, prompts, user data confinement

- `ELIZA_STATE_DIR` (default `~/.local/state/eliza`) maps to a private,
  sealed-key-encrypted volume that only mounts after attestation-gated key
  release. (dstack does this via LUKS2 — see the LUKS2 advisory in §5; we must
  bind the volume key to attestation, not to a host-readable key.)
- KV-cache and intermediate tensors live only in confidential (memory-encrypted)
  pages. There is no swap to a non-measured device; if swap is required it must
  be encrypted with an in-domain key.
- Cleartext crosses the boundary only through the shared-page virtio path and
  only for data the user marked exportable (a measured policy field). UI text,
  rendering, and notifications are explicitly allowed outside.

### 2.4 Maps to the NPU-as-confidential-I/O and eliza-1

- The chip lane's NPU private queues (lane 03, `npuProtected` claim,
  `npuFirmware` measurement) are the hardware mechanism that keeps weights and
  activations off shared buses during inference. The agent's contract with that
  layer is: do not release `model-key` and do not start private inference unless
  `claims.npuProtected === true` and `measurements.npuFirmware` matches the
  manifest. This is a policy assertion the agent already supports; the plan adds
  it to the production profile (§4.2).
- eliza-1 is the in-domain local model runtime. The plan's only requirement on
  it: it must accept weights from an in-memory decrypted buffer (no temp file
  on a non-measured FS) and must not log prompts/weights anywhere reachable by
  the host (§4.4).

### 2.5 Confidential inference is CPU-only (device CVM or cloud dStack CVM)

Confidential inference runs **on-CPU inside a CVM** — never on a confidential
GPU. **NVIDIA H100 / confidential-GPU is out of scope.** Two confidential
placements, both CPU TDX/TVM:

| Aspect | Device-local CVM/TVM (default) | Cloud dStack CVM (opt-in) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Where weights decrypt | On-device CVM/TVM (on-CPU) | dStack **CPU-based Intel TDX** CVM (on-CPU) |
| Verifier/KMS | On-device verifier (`eliza-local-verifier`) | Cloud dStack KMS (added to `allowedProviders`) |
| What the agent sends | nothing leaves the device | nothing leaves the cloud CVM (inference is on-CPU in-domain) |
| Extra claim required | `npuProtected` + `npuFirmware` (on-device secure I/O) | none beyond the CPU TDX quote/measurement |
| Policy difference | `required:true`, local golden digests | adds the Cloud dStack KMS provider |

The agent runs the **same** `evaluateTeeEvidencePolicy` for both; only the policy
object differs (allowed providers / measurements). Inference sent to a
**non-attested external endpoint** (a third-party model API) is **not
confidential** — cleartext to that operator — and is the opt-in, non-confidential
path for user-marked-exportable data only, not a confidential-GPU path.

---

## 3. End-to-end attestation + key release contract

### 3.1 The flow, by component

```text
device evidence (OS/silicon)                      [OS + chip lanes]
  -> deployment plugin emits TeeEvidence            [registered provider]
  -> normalizeTeeEvidence(...)                       [tee-evidence.ts]  STRICT
  -> evaluateTeeEvidencePolicy(evidence, policy)     [tee-policy.ts]    TRUST DECISION
       policy from resolveTeeRuntimePolicy(env)      [tee-runtime-config.ts]
       + mergeTeeRevocationsIntoPolicy(...)          [tee-revocation.ts]
       + production profile (§4.2)                   [NEW]
  -> trusted? release secret                         [tee-key-release.ts]
       model-key | agent-session | remote-signing
  -> unseal: decrypt weights / mount state / sign    [NEW consumers]
```

### 3.2 Freshness / nonce / report_data binding (must be added)

This is the contract the docs specify but the client does not yet implement:

1. The agent generates an ephemeral X25519 keypair `epk` per release request.
2. The agent obtains a fresh challenge `nonce` from the verifier/KMS (or, in
   local mode, from the local verifier).
3. The quote request sets `report_data = SHA256(nonce || epk_pub)` so the quote
   is bound to *this* live channel and is not replayable.
4. `policy.expectedNonce` is set to the issued nonce; `policy.maxAgeMs` bounds
   staleness; `evaluateTeeEvidencePolicy` rejects `missing-nonce`/`nonce-mismatch`/
   `timestamp-stale`.
5. The KMS wraps the released key to `epk_pub`; the agent unwraps in-domain.

`HttpTeeKeyReleaseClient` must be extended (or a `RaTlsTeeKeyReleaseClient`
added) to do steps 1–3 and to *verify* the returned key was wrapped to its epk.
**Never accept a key for a quote whose `report_data` the client did not bind to
a nonce it generated.**

### 3.3 Measurement matching set (the agent's required claims)

For a production local-in-TEE confidential-AI release the policy must require:

- `requiredMeasurements`: `agent`, `policy`, `container`/`compose`, `os`, `boot`,
  `device`, and `npuFirmware` (when local private inference is enabled), each
  matching the signed reproducible-build manifest's golden digest.
- `requiredClaims`: `debugDisabled:true`, `secureBoot:true`, `memoryEncrypted:true`,
  `ioProtected:true`, `productionLifecycle:true`, and `npuProtected:true` (local)
  or `gpuProtected:true` (cloud-routed).
- `minSecurityVersion`: the anti-rollback floor from the RoT counter.
- `expectedNonce` + `maxAgeMs`: per §3.2.
- revocations merged from the signed revocation manifest.

### 3.4 Rollback / revocation

- Rollback: `minSecurityVersion` + `revokedSecurityVersions` (both supported).
- Revocation: `revokedMeasurements` per name. The revocation manifest is signed
  by an authority (`authority` field) — **the agent must verify that signature
  before merging** (gap: `mergeTeeRevocationsIntoPolicy` trusts the manifest;
  add signature verification at the load boundary in `tee-runtime-config.ts`).

### 3.5 Map to dstack KMS deterministic app keys

dstack's KMS runs in its own TEE, verifies the TDX quote, and derives a
*deterministic per-app key bound to the measured app identity* (compose digest +
args + env) with authorization enforced by on-chain policy that operators cannot
bypass. The agent's `model-key`/`agent-session`/`remote-signing` scopes map to
dstack `keyId`s; the binding inputs (agent/policy/container measurements) in our
`deriveKeyMaterial` model mirror dstack's app-identity binding. In production the
`LocalTeeKeyReleaseClient` HMAC model is replaced by the real dstack guest-agent
socket (`/var/run/dstack.sock`) → KMS path; our `HttpTeeKeyReleaseClient` becomes
an RA-TLS client to that socket/endpoint.

---

## 4. Secret & capability gating

### 4.1 `ELIZA_TEE_REQUIRED=true` behavior (must be wired)

Today `resolveTeeRuntimePolicy` returns `{ required:true, ... }` but no boot code
consumes it. Plan: at agent boot, if `ELIZA_TEE_REQUIRED==="true"` (or a policy
resolves with `required:true`), the agent must:

- collect evidence via the configured provider and evaluate it once at boot;
- if not trusted, **refuse to release any high-value secret** (model-key,
  signing key, remote-signing) and refuse to sync remote capability plugins —
  the agent may still boot in a degraded, secret-less mode but must surface the
  failed decision (structured logger, `[TeeBootGate]`), never silently continue
  with secrets.
- wrap the active `SignerBackend` in `TeeSignerBackend` so *every* sign re-checks.
- gate `model-key` release behind the same policy (so weights stay sealed).

### 4.2 A single production profile (new, prevents footguns)

Add a `teeProductionProfile()` helper that returns the non-negotiable claim/
freshness floor and is intersected with the resolved policy, so a caller cannot
forget `debugDisabled`/`memoryEncrypted`/freshness in production:

```ts
// strongly typed, no fallbacks; rejects dev/debug evidence by construction
export function teeProductionProfile(): Required<Pick<TeeEvidencePolicy,
  "required" | "requiredClaims">> & Pick<TeeEvidencePolicy, "maxAgeMs"> {
  return {
    required: true,
    requiredClaims: {
      debugDisabled: true,
      secureBoot: true,
      memoryEncrypted: true,
      ioProtected: true,
      productionLifecycle: true,
    },
    maxAgeMs: 300_000,
  };
}
```

The boot path must merge this into the resolved policy whenever the build is a
production/`stable` channel, never accepting DevMode/debug evidence under it.

### 4.3 Host↔guest capability bridge + RemoteSigningService

Per `tee-protected-agent-vm.md`: the host owns UI/network/storage-brokering; the
guest owns secrets, signing keys, decrypted model keys, private tool output.
Allowed host→guest calls: `plugin.modules.list`, approved remote plugin
actions, workspace-scoped file IO, terminal exec only when policy allows the
endpoint, and signing through `RemoteSigningService`. Denied by default: host FS
escape, raw device access, unmeasured plugin loading, unsigned policy mutation,
and **secret export to host logs/env dumps/crash reports/analytics**.
`RemoteSigningService` must use `TeeSignerBackend` so the host can request a
signature but the key never leaves the domain and every sign re-attests.

### 4.4 Deny secret export to host surfaces (new gate)

- No secret/weight/prompt value may be written to a logger that ships off-domain,
  to `process.env` dumps, to crash/telemetry payloads, or to a non-measured FS.
- Add a redaction assertion at the structured-logger boundary and a CI gate that
  greps the crash/telemetry serializers for secret-scope keys. (Logger-only per
  commandment 9; never `console`.)

### 4.5 Fail-closed on missing/stale/debug/mismatched evidence

The decision union already encodes every failure cause. The plan is to ensure
**every** high-value path routes through `evaluateTeeEvidencePolicy` and throws
on `!trusted`: plugin sync (done — `remote-capability-endpoint-provider`),
signing (done — `TeeSignerBackend`), model-key release (to wire), agent-session
secret release (to wire), and remote capability calls (done). No path may have a
fallback that proceeds without a `trusted:true` decision.

---

## 5. dstack provider hardening (defenses against the known issues)

The brief and dstack's own advisories establish the threat classes. Concrete
agent-side defenses:

1. **KMS attestation bypass** — never trust a key the agent did not bind to its
   own fresh nonce + epk (§3.2). The agent independently runs
   `evaluateTeeEvidencePolicy` on the evidence *before* using any returned key;
   it does not delegate the trust decision to the KMS response alone. Verify the
   returned key is wrapped to the agent's epk.
2. **Permissive DevMode auth / fake-quote pathways** — the production profile
   (§4.2) requires `debugDisabled:true` and `productionLifecycle:true`; DevMode
   or simulated quotes (e.g. `quote:"simulated-cove-quote"`, `hardwareVendor:"mock-*"`)
   must be rejected. Add an explicit allowlist of accepted `verifier`/`hardwareVendor`
   values in production, and refuse `kind` values that indicate mock providers.
   The *real quote signature* must be verified (BLOCKED on hardware; see §7) —
   until then production must not claim hardware trust.
3. **Disabled-TLS-verification gateway** — the KMS client must use RA-TLS with
   full certificate-chain verification pinned to the expected KMS identity;
   **refuse plain HTTP and refuse `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`**. Add a guard
   that throws if the KMS URL is not `https:`/RA-TLS in production
   (`normalizeBaseUrl` already enforces http(s); tighten to https-only +
   identity pin).
4. **KMS identity pinning** — pin the KMS's measured identity (its own quote /
   on-chain policy identity) so a rogue or downgraded KMS cannot answer. Add
   `expectedKmsMeasurement` / `expectedKmsPublicKey` to the release client config
   and verify it on the RA-TLS handshake.
5. **World-readable key material / decrypted env vars** — never place secrets or
   the decrypted weights/model-key in env vars or world-readable files. Keep them
   in-process memory; the sealed state volume key must be attestation-bound, not
   a static host-readable key (the LUKS2 advisory GHSA-jxq2-hpw3-m5wf is exactly
   this risk). Zeroize key buffers after use.
6. **Decompression bomb / malformed evidence** — `normalizeTeeEvidence` already
   rejects malformed shapes; every deployment provider must cap evidence/quote
   payload size before parsing.
7. **Cert / constant-time issues** — use constant-time comparison for nonce and
   wrapped-key checks; rely on a vetted RA-TLS library for cert verification
   rather than hand-rolled parsing.

These are agent-side compensating controls; they do not fix dstack itself but
ensure the agent never extends trust to a quote/KMS it cannot independently
verify and pin.

---

## 6. The agent↔OS↔silicon contract

### 6.1 Fields the agent consumes (provider-neutral)

The agent consumes only the normalized `TeeEvidence` from `tee-evidence.ts`,
regardless of provider (`dstack`/`tdx`/`cove`/`eliza-vault`). Required from the
layer below:

- `kind`, `provider`, `securityVersion`, `freshness{nonce,timestamp,verifier}`,
  `quote`, `certificatePem`, `reportData`.
- `measurements`: `boot`, `os`, `agent`, `policy`, `device`, `container`/`compose`
  (containerized), `npuFirmware` (local private inference), `gpuFirmware`
  (cloud confidential GPU).
- `claims`: `debugDisabled`, `secureBoot`, `memoryEncrypted`, `ioProtected`,
  `productionLifecycle`, `npuProtected` (local), `gpuProtected` (cloud).

### 6.2 Is the existing `requiredClaims` set the right contract?

Yes. `debugDisabled`, `secureBoot`, `memoryEncrypted`, `ioProtected` are the
correct core set, and the type already carries `productionLifecycle`,
`npuProtected`, `gpuProtected`. For confidential AI the only additions needed
are *usage of* the already-present fields:

- **Use `npuProtected` + `measurements.npuFirmware`** as a hard gate for local
  private inference (present in types and fixtures; not yet required by any
  production profile).
- `gpuProtected` + `measurements.gpuFirmware` exist in the type for
  completeness but are **out of scope / no consumer** — confidential-GPU (H100)
  is not pursued; confidential inference runs on-CPU inside the CVM.
- Consider a `monitor` measurement name (TSM/security-manager digest) for the
  CoVE path — chip §2.1/§3.1 emits `monitor`; `TeeMeasurementName` is an open
  string so it already type-checks, but add `"monitor"` to the named union for
  discoverability.
- Optionally add a `modelWeights` measurement name so the released-against
  weights digest can be matched (defense in depth: bind `model-key` release to
  the expected weights digest). Open-string already allows it; naming it makes
  it a first-class contract field.

No breaking changes to the type are required — the contract is right; the work

## 7. Sequenced Plan

Effort in person-weeks (PW). Every blocked item names its dependency and stays
fail-closed.

### Phase A — buildable now (no hardware), software-only

All Phase A items are **DONE** (software-only, no hardware). They verify a signed
evidence *document* and fail closed; none of them claims hardware-verified trust —
that stays Phase B/C, BLOCKED.

| ID | Status | Work item | Gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | DONE | Extend `tee-full-stack-local.ts` with real policy vectors: per-topology policies (local-only, desktop, cloud-routed) + golden/tampered fixtures for every decision reason (kind/provider/measurement/version/nonce/timestamp/claim/revoked). | `tee-full-stack-local` |
| A2 | DONE | Negative-test matrix asserting each `reason` in the decision union for crafted evidence. Pure data, no `any`. | `tee-evidence-policy.matrix.test.ts` |
| A3 | DONE | `teeProductionProfile()` + profile-merge helper (§4.2); rejects DevMode/debug evidence. | `tee-production-profile.ts` / `.test.ts` |
| A4 | DONE | Boot wiring (§4.1): `runTeeBootGate` in `runtime/eliza.ts`, fail-closed `[TeeBootGate]`, gate model-key + agent-session release; cross-module state via `tee-boot-gate-state.ts`. | `tee-boot-gate*.ts` / `.test.ts` |
| A5 | DONE | Revocation-manifest Ed25519 signature verification at load (§3.4); deny unsigned/invalid manifests. | `tee-revocation.ts` / `tee-revocation-signature.test.ts` |
| A6 | DONE | dstack provider hardening (no hardware): payload size cap, https-only + KMS-identity-pin config fields, constant-time nonce/key compare, reject mock `verifier`/`hardwareVendor`/simulated quotes under production profile. | unit |
| A7 | DONE | Nonce + epk binding in the key-release client (§3.2): generate epk, issue/echo nonce, set `report_data`, verify key wrapped to epk. (Crypto only; no real quote yet.) | `tee-key-release.ts` / `.test.ts` |
| A8 | DONE | Confidential-inference unseal *plumbing* (§2.2 steps 4–7) against the mock KMS: encrypt weights at rest, release `model-key`, decrypt in-memory, hand to the local runtime; assert no temp-file/plaintext on disk and no secret in logs (§4.4). | `tee-confidential-inference.ts` / `.test.ts` |
| A9 | DONE | CI gate (§4.4): grep crash/telemetry serializers + env-dump paths for secret-scope keys; fail on leak. In-lane via `tee-secret-hygiene.test.ts`; repo-wide CLI gate `packages/scripts/audit-tee-secret-leak.mjs` (`--self-test`). | lint gate |

Critical path for Phase A: A3 → A4 → A8 (the headline unseal plumbing depends on
the production profile and boot wiring). A1/A2/A5/A6/A7/A9 parallelized.

### Phase B — cloud-TDX-gated (real dstack KMS on CPU-based Intel TDX)

The agent runs inside a **CPU-based Intel TDX CVM** (Phala dStack). The whole
agent — runtime, DB, vault/secrets, and any on-CPU inference — is the
confidential workload. **Confidential-GPU (NVIDIA H100) is out of scope** (was
B4); the trust boundary is the CPU CVM, not a GPU.

| ID | Work item | Effort | Gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B1 | Real dstack guest-agent integration: read evidence from `/var/run/dstack.sock` / `DSTACK_TAPPD_URL`, request real TDX quote, populate `TeeEvidence`. | 3 | dstack CVM on CPU TDX |
| B2 | Real TDX quote verification (Intel PCS/QvL): verify quote signature, RTMRs, and `report_data == H(nonce\|\|epk)`. **The current provider does none of this.** | 4 | CPU TDX hardware |
| B3 | Real RA-TLS KMS client with KMS-identity pinning; deterministic app-key release for `model-key`/`agent-session`/`remote-signing`. | 3 | dstack KMS |

**Confidential inference policy (no H100):** inference that must stay
confidential runs **on-CPU inside the CVM** (cleartext weights/prompts/KV-cache
never leave the CPU TDX domain). Cloud-routed inference to an external endpoint
is **outside** the confidential boundary by definition — a documented limitation,
not an H100/`gpuProtected` work item.

Phase B is **BLOCKED on CPU TDX hardware availability**. Until B2 lands, the
system must not claim hardware-verified trust; it verifies a signed evidence
document only. State this in any release notes.

### Phase C — chip-silicon-gated (real CoVE quote on E1)

| ID | Work item | Effort | Gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C1 | Consume real CoVE quote from the E1 in-domain attestation agent (chip §3.1); verify DICE/RoT cert chain + RTMR/`report_data` binding. | 4 | E1 silicon / CoVE QEMU+Salus |
| C2 | NPU private-queue gate: enforce `npuProtected` + `npuFirmware` before private inference (binds chip lane 03). | 2 | E1 secure I/O |
| C3 | Attestation-bound sealed state volume (replace host-readable LUKS2 key with attestation-released key). | 2 | E1 + KMS |

Phase C is **BLOCKED on E1 silicon / a riscv64 CoVE QEMU+Salus target** (chip
lane WI-6/WI-7/WI-9). It stays fail-closed with the named dependency.

### Fail-closed gate summary

- Phase A gates close immediately (software, mock KMS, real crypto).
- Phase B gates stay BLOCKED on CPU TDX hardware; the agent must refuse to
  assert hardware trust until B2 verifies real quotes. (Confidential-GPU / H100
  is out of scope — CPU TDX CVM only.)
- Phase C gates stay BLOCKED on E1 silicon; same rule.
- At every phase, `ELIZA_TEE_REQUIRED=true` + production profile means: no
  trusted evidence → no model-key, no signing, no remote-plugin sync, no private
  inference. Degraded boot is allowed; silent secret release is never allowed.

## 8. Open decisions for a human

- **Weights encryption envelope** — AES-256-GCM vs XChaCha20-Poly1305, and
  whether weights are a single blob or per-shard (per-shard lets large models
  stream-decrypt without a full plaintext copy in memory). Recommend per-shard.
- **`modelWeights` measurement** — bind `model-key` release to the expected
  weights digest as defense in depth? Recommend yes (defense in depth, cheap).
- **Local verifier trust root** — for local-only mode the on-device verifier is
  rooted in the RoT-derived key; confirm the local verifier's measured identity
  is itself in `measurements.policy`/`device` so it can't be swapped.
- **Cloud KMS as escrow** — whether cross-device key escrow via Eliza Cloud is in
  scope for v1 (the chip doc lists it as optional). Out of scope unless requested.
