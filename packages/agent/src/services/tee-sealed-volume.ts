/**
 * Attestation-bound sealed state-volume key manager (plan §2.3 / Phase C item
 * C3). Replaces dstack's host-readable LUKS2 key (GHSA-jxq2-hpw3-m5wf, plan
 * §5.5) with a key that is RELEASED ONLY after a passing attestation.
 *
 * SCOPE OF THIS MODULE — the security-critical, host-agnostic binding layer:
 * it requests the state-volume key through the existing attestation-gated
 * key-release + policy path and refuses (fail-closed) when the evidence is not
 * trusted or the boot gate already blocked secrets. The key is bound to the
 * measured agent/policy/device identity, so a tampered OS/agent yields a
 * DIFFERENT key and the volume simply will not decrypt — the negative path is
 * enforced by *data unavailability*, not by a software flag that could be
 * patched out. This mirrors the confidential-inference `model-key` unseal
 * pattern (`tee-confidential-inference.ts`).
 *
 * NOT IN SCOPE — the OS layer (`elizaOS/os:packages/os/docs/tee-os-implementation-plan.md`
 * §3.4): the dm-crypt/LUKS2 plumbing itself. A mount hook in the confidential
 * guest calls {@link unsealStateVolumeKey} BEFORE mounting the state dir,
 * hands the released key (or the LUKS passphrase recovered from the
 * sealed metadata blob) to `cryptsetup`, and refuses to mount when this throws.
 * That plumbing is host-specific and not unit-testable in memory; the
 * attestation→key binding here is, and it is the part that matters for the
 * security property.
 *
 * HARDWARE BOUNDARY (fail-closed): real TDX/CoVE quote-signature verification
 * is BLOCKED on hardware (plan Phase B2/C1). This path verifies a normalized
 * evidence document + measurement match via the key-release client only; it
 * must not be presented as hardware-verified trust until B2/C1 land.
