/**
 * Dashboard/REST chat sources that flow through `generateChatResponse` and can

 * agent's result back to the user it calls `runtime.sendMessageToTarget` with
 * `target.source` set to the ORIGINATING message's `content.source` (see
 * `SubAgentRouter.buildReplyCallback` → `origin.source`, stamped onto the
 * session metadata by `TASKS op=spawn_agent` as `resolvedSpawnSource`). None of
 * these sources is owned by a real connector, so without an explicit send
 * handler the relay throws "No send handler registered for source: …" and the
 * sub-agent's result silently never reaches the user — the chat just shows a
 * "something glitched" failure even though the work completed.
 *
 *   - `client_chat`        — primary web/app dashboard chat (buildUserMessages
 *                            default; also the proactive-autonomy surface).
 *   - `agent_message_api`  — REST `POST /agents/:id/message`
 *                            (chat-routes.ts; `platformName || agent_message_api`).
 *   - `compat_openai`      — `/v1/chat/completions` OpenAI-compat endpoint.
 *   - `compat_anthropic`   — `/v1/messages` Anthropic-compat endpoint.
 *
 * NOT included (they are not real inbound `origin.source` values that reach the
 * relay): `sub_agent` (the router's internal marker — unwrapped to the real
 * `originSource` in tasks.ts before it ever becomes a spawn source), and
 * `orchestrator` (only a notifier/trajectory label, never a `content.source`).
 *
 * Arbitrary/unknown dashboard-origin sources (a client-supplied `body.source`
 * on the dashboard chat, or a custom `platformName` on `agent_message_api`)
 * are handled by the default-fallback wrapper below — see
