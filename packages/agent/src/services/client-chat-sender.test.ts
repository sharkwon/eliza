/**
 * Tests for registerClientChatSendHandler — the wiring that relays the agent's
 * outbound messages back into dashboard / REST conversations. Covers which relay
 * sources get a send handler, delivery into the matching conversation (including
 * an unknown dashboard-origin source routed via the default fallback), not
 * hijacking a real connector's own handler, cross-conversation safety, and
 * single-owner swarm delivery. Most cases use a deterministic state stand-in;
 * transport ownership runs through AgentRuntime and InMemoryDatabaseAdapter.
