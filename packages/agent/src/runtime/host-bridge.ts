/**
 * Agent host bridge — the downward-injection seam that replaces the former
 * memoized dynamic import of the app-core `agent-bridge` subpath (a reverse
 * edge from agent up into the host).
 *
 * `@elizaos/agent` is the lower layer; `@elizaos/app-core` is the host that
 * runs it. A small set of host-owned capabilities (OS wallet-key hydration,
 * vault bootstrap/access, the account-pool singleton, build-variant flags, and
 * the cloud-SSO pair route) used to be pulled UP from agent into app-core via a
 * memoized dynamic import of the `app-core/agent-bridge` subpath. That edge put
 * `@elizaos/app-core ↔ @elizaos/agent` in a real dependency cycle (#9626),
 * hidden from `madge` only by the narrow-subpath `.d.ts`.
 *
 * The host now INJECTS these capabilities via {@link setAgentHostBridge} before
 * booting the runtime (see app-core's boot funnel). When no host installs a
 * bridge — the on-device mobile bundle and any standalone-agent boot — the
 * built-in {@link defaultAgentHostBridge} supplies the exact no-op behavior the
 * mobile `app-core-runtime.cjs` stub used to provide. Agent therefore never
 * imports `@elizaos/app-core`, static or dynamic.
