/**
 * Cross-list view-id drift guard (#8797).
 *
 * Four+ independent per-view lists describe the view system, each owned by a
 * different module:
 *   - BUILTIN_VIEWS              (packages/agent/src/api/builtin-views.ts)
 *   - MATCHER_VIEW_IDS/VIEW_NOUNS (plugin-app-control view-command-matcher)
 *   - INTENT_VIEW_IDS            (plugin-app-control views-show resolveIntentView)
 *   - CONTEXT_VIEWS             (plugin-app-control view-context evaluator)
 *   - view action affinity      (this package's view-action-affinity)
 *
 * Nothing previously asserted they agree on the set of view ids, so a change to
 * one (rename a view, add a contextual surface) could silently leave the others
 * stale. This test fails when they drift: every contextual/intent view must be
 * reachable by the rigid matcher, every user-facing builtin must have matcher
 * nouns, and host/plugin action affinity must be structurally sound.
