/**
 * Core plugin package lists shared by runtime startup and the API server.
 *
 * Keeping this in a standalone module avoids a circular dependency between
 * `api/server.ts` and `runtime/eliza.ts`.
 *
 * ## Platform/profile eligibility (arch-audit #12089 item 2)
 *
 * Platform and profile membership USED to live in five hand-maintained,
 * order-coupled name lists (`DESKTOP_ONLY_PLUGINS`, `MOBILE_CORE_PLUGINS`,
 * `MOBILE_VIEW_PLUGINS`, `ELIZAOS_ANDROID_CORE_PLUGINS`,
 * `ELIZAOS_ANDROID_TERMINAL_PLUGINS`). A plugin's eligibility for a given
 * platform was a fact about the plugin, but it was asserted centrally in the
 * host and had to be re-typed into whichever list(s) it belonged to. That is
 * exactly the drift trap the audit flagged: adding a mobile-safe plugin meant
 * remembering to touch `MOBILE_CORE_PLUGINS`, and there was no single place
 * that said "this plugin runs on mobile."
 *
 * Eligibility now lives in ONE declarative capability table
 * ({@link CORE_PLUGIN_PROFILE_METADATA}); the host filters that table by
 * capability. The legacy name lists below are DERIVED from the table via
 * {@link selectCorePluginsByProfile} — they remain as a stable, host-owned
 * read surface (nothing else in the codebase has to change), but they are no
 * longer an independent source that can drift. `plugin-sql` is the only entry
 * marked `requiredBootstrap`; everything else is opt-in-by-capability.
 *
 * A drift-guard test (`core-plugins-profile-metadata.test.ts`) asserts the
 * intended derived membership and that exactly one plugin is required
 * bootstrap, so a future edit that silently changes a platform load set fails
 * CI instead of shipping.
 */

/**
 * Declarative platform/profile capability flags for a single core plugin.
 *
 * Each flag answers a capability question about the plugin, not a placement
 * question about a list. The host reads these to build every platform load set,
 * so a plugin declaring (say) `mobileCore: true` is the single fact that puts it
 * on the mobile boot — no parallel list to keep in sync.
