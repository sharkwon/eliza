/**
 * Public barrel for the `@elizaos/agent` runtime module: re-exports the boot
 * orchestration (`eliza.ts`), the "eliza" plugin factory, plugin
 * collection/lifecycle/resolution, conversation compaction, owner-entity and
 * role helpers, release-channel policy, trajectory persistence/query, and the
 * version resolver. `plugin-resolver.ts` is re-exported by name rather than
 * `export *` so only the resolver entry points surface through this barrel.
