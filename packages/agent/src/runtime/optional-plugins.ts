 * table in `eliza.ts`: a plugin added to the table without a matching branch
 * became non-bundleable with no error.
 *
 * Instead, this module owns the list, `optional-plugin-imports.generated.ts` is
 * code-generated from it (literal imports the bundler sees), and
 * `optional-plugins.test.ts` fails if the generated file drifts or if a
 * descriptor-table entry has no importer. Regenerate with:
 *
 *   bun run --cwd packages/agent gen:optional-plugin-imports
 *
 * @module optional-plugins
