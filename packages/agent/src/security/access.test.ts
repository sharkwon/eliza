/**
 * Fail-closed error-path coverage for hasPrivateAccess (#12265). A throw from
 * the core private-access check is a broken role/world-resolution pipeline (a
 * missing world returns null upstream, not a throw). The handler must stay
 * fail-closed (deny) AND surface the failure via runtime.reportError so a
 * silently-denying broken check becomes observable. The tests drive the real
 * agent access wrapper and core role primitives with minimal typed runtime
 * collaborators.
