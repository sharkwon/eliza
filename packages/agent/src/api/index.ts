/**
 * Public barrel for the agent HTTP API surface (`@elizaos/agent/api`):

 *
 * App-manager and wallet routes live in their own plugins; the re-exports here
 * preserve the historical `@elizaos/agent` import path. Wallet loads lazily so
 * importing this barrel during server startup does not drag in the full
