/**
 * Absent-plugin route stub registry.
 *
 * When an optional plugin/feature is not loaded, its status/probe routes still
 * need to answer the dashboard SPA with a stable "capability unavailable"
 * snapshot rather than a 404. Historically each such stub was hand-written as an
 * inline response literal inside the host's `handleBuiltinOptionalRoutes`
 * (packages/agent/src/api/server.ts) if-chain, and several of them were *also*
 * hand-copied into `handleMobileOptionalRoutes`
 * (packages/agent/src/api/mobile-optional-routes.ts). That duplication is the
 * "host fabricates absent plugins' route responses with hand-mirrored schemas"
 * hazard (arch-audit #12089 item 12 / issue #12662): the two copies had already
 * drifted (e.g. the lifeops POST `reason` string), and every new stub multiplied
 * the surface that could silently diverge from what the real plugin returns.
 *
 * This module owns those pure-fabrication stub payloads once, as declared data
 * keyed by a stable `capabilityId`. Both host handlers resolve from this single
 * registry instead of re-typing the schema. A stub is intentionally limited to a
 * pure function of the request (path + query) — anything that reads live runtime
 * state, such as wallet addresses, stays in its own handler and is NOT a stub
 * here, because those responses are not fabrications.
 *
 * Guardrails:
 *  - `buildBody` must be deterministic and side-effect free (no I/O, no plugin
 *    loading). It may read the request URL/query only.
 *  - Adding a stub here does not change routing precedence: the live plugin
 *    route (registered via `runtime.routes`) is still consulted first by the
 *    dispatcher, so a loaded plugin always wins over its stub.
