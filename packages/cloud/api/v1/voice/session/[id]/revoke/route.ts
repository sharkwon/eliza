/**
 * POST /api/v1/voice/session/:id/revoke (contract §7.1, SEC-6).
 *
 * Revoke-to-silence: adds the session's `jti` to the short-TTL revocation store
 * AND severs the live Ink+Sonic sockets. On the worker that holds the live
 * session, the sever is synchronous and instant (well under the 500ms bound).
 * On a different worker, the revoked `jti` blocks any reconnect and the live
 * session's own revocation poll severs it within the poll window; the client
 * must re-mint to speak again.
 *
 * Only the owning org/user may revoke a session — a revoke by a different tenant
 * cannot reach another tenant's live session (the live session is only severable
 * by-id on the worker that owns it, and the durable revoke is keyed by jti which
 * a non-owner cannot obtain).
