CRITICAL: Focus on UTILITY-BASED agents that help with real tasks. Mix different domains:
- Business & productivity (sales, support, analytics, scheduling)
- Creative & content (writing, design, research, editing)
- Technical & development (coding, debugging, documentation, DevOps)
- Personal & lifestyle (fitness, finance, learning, wellness)
- Communication & social (community management, translation, moderation)

Keep concepts:
- SHORT (5-8 words maximum)
- PRACTICAL (real utility, not fantasy)
- SPECIFIC (clear use case)
- VARIED (different industries/domains)

Examples of GOOD prompts:
- "Technical documentation writer with dry humor"
- "Personal finance advisor for freelancers"
- "Code reviewer focused on security best practices"
- "Social media content strategist for startups"
- "Customer support specialist with endless patience"
- "Data analyst explaining insights in simple terms"
- "Meeting notes summarizer with action items"
- "Fitness coach for busy professionals"

BAD prompts (too long, too fantasy):
- "Renaissance alchemist trapped in simulation..."
- "Time-traveling wizard from the year..."

Return ONLY a JSON array of exactly 4 strings, nothing else. No markdown, no explanation.
