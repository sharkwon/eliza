/**
 * CI showcase-account seeding (#9300).
 *
 * The flagship example apps (EDAD, Clone Ur Crush) are continuously deployed and
 * exercised against Eliza Cloud by a dedicated CI showcase account funded with
 * effectively-infinite credits. This helper seeds that account THROUGH THE REAL
 * billing code path - `creditsService.addCredits` - so the showcase loop drives
 * the production credit ledger (the org `credit_balance` column and a real
 * `credit_transactions` row), NOT a mock balance. That is the whole point of the
 * "infinite credits" requirement: a CI bypass that still exercises the real
 * usage/billing pipeline so a regression in it fails the loop.
 *
 * ## Why "effectively infinite" instead of a literal bypass
 *
 * Granting a very large real balance ($1,000,000) keeps EVERY downstream check
 * honest: each monetized transaction runs `appCreditsService.deductCredits`, which
 * debits the same `FOR UPDATE` org ledger a paying customer hits, computes the
 * creator markup from app settings, and records the creator earning. The account
 * simply never runs dry across a run. A special-cased "skip billing" branch would
 * do the opposite - it would route the showcase account around the code we most
 * want to keep green.
 *
 * ## Isolation from real revenue
 *
 * Two layers, both observable:
 *  1. **Ephemeral DB (mock-stack loop).** The per-PR / nightly mock-stack loop
 *     runs against an in-process PGlite DB that is created and torn down per run.
 *     Nothing it writes can ever touch production revenue - there is no shared
 *     store.
 *  2. **Tagged ledger + reserved namespace (real-staging loop).** Every grant is
 *     stamped with {@link SHOWCASE_SEED_METADATA} (`type: "showcase_seed"`,
 *     `isolated: true`) and the account uses the reserved
 *     `@ci-showcase.elizacloud.test` email namespace and `ci-showcase-` slug
 *     prefix, so a revenue-reporting query CAN exclude showcase activity by that
 *     tag/namespace — auditable and excludable rather than silently mixed in.
 *     (Wiring that exclusion filter on the real revenue dashboard is the operator
 *     step when the real-staging showcase account is provisioned; the tag exists
 *     so it is a filter, not a schema migration.)
 *
 * See `packages/cloud/e2e/docs/showcase-apps-coverage.md` for the full
 * runbook (how it is seeded, kept isolated, and activated on real staging).
