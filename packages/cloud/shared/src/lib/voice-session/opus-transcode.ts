/**
 * Opus <-> PCM transcode seam (contract §10, Phase-4-ready, stubbed in P1).
 *
 * The canonical uplink/downlink codec is PCM16 (matches Cartesia Ink ingest
 * and Cartesia output exactly, zero transcode). Opus is the FUTURE codec for
 * the BLE wearable mic uplink and for bandwidth-constrained cellular downlink.
 * Those paths are documented seams, not implemented in Phase 1 — the capture
 * device layer already owns Opus decode today, so the server transcode is a
 * fallback that Phase 4 wires with a real codec.
 *
 * These stubs fail LOUD if invoked in Phase 1 rather than silently returning
 * wrong bytes: an `opus` negotiation reaching here before Phase 4 is a wiring
 * bug, and a fake transcode would corrupt a paid provider stream.
