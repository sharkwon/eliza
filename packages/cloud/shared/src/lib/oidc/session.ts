/**
 * Cookie-only session resolution for the OIDC authorization endpoint.
 *
 * This deliberately does NOT call `getCurrentUser(c)`. That resolver accepts a
 * Bearer JWT and JIT-provisions an account on a miss, and neither belongs in an
 * authorization redirect: `/authorize` is a top-level browser navigation, so a
 * Bearer could only come from a non-browser caller, and account creation must
 * not be a side effect of a relying party sending a user here.
 *
 * The cookie reaches this endpoint because `steward-token` is scoped to
 * `Domain=elizacloud.ai` and `SameSite=Lax`, which is sent on a cross-site
 * top-level GET. Two consequences worth knowing: a change to `SameSite=Strict`
 * silently breaks SSO with a "not signed in" loop, and — because sibling
 * `*.elizacloud.ai` hosts serve user content and JS there can PLANT a
 * parent-domain cookie — the explicit-logout marker check below is load-bearing
 * rather than optional.
 *
 * The session's Steward tenant is deliberately NOT carried into the claim
 * builder. `/userinfo` runs with an access token and no session, so a
 * session-derived claim would exist in the ID token and vanish on the next read;
 * `tenant_id` therefore comes from stored rows only (see `./claims.ts`).
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS AN AUTHENTICATION TIME. A Steward access token is re-minted
 * on every refresh from already-verified claims (`auth/steward-refresh`), so
 * its `iat` moves without the user authenticating; a session established weeks
 * ago carries an `iat` from minutes ago. `issuedAt` is therefore used ONLY to
 * order this token against the explicit-logout marker, and no `auth_time` claim
 * is derived from it — see `./tokens.ts`.
