/**
 * At-rest encryption for `agent_sandboxes.environment_vars` (#11332).
 *
 * The column is plain jsonb, and it is the one place users can land BYO
 * provider keys today (PATCH /v1/eliza/agents/:id/environment, agent create,
 * coding-container create). Without this layer those secrets sit in plaintext
 * at rest. Values whose key looks secret-bearing are encrypted on WRITE with
 * the EXISTING org-scoped envelope crypto (`FieldEncryptionService`:
 * AES-256-GCM, per-org DEK wrapped by `SECRETS_MASTER_KEY`, `enc:v1:` encoded
 * strings — the same primitive that already protects tenant DB DSNs) and
 * decrypted only at the points the env is materialized for the agent (container
 * create, fleet upgrade, runtime bootstrap), so the running agent still sees
 * the real values.
 *
 * Backward compatible by construction:
 * - Decrypt passes any non-`enc:v1:` value through untouched, so legacy
 *   plaintext rows keep working with no forced backfill. Legacy plaintext
 *   secrets are opportunistically re-encrypted the next time the row's env is
 *   written through the service.
 * - When `SECRETS_MASTER_KEY` is not configured, writes stay plaintext (exact
 *   legacy behavior) with a structured warning, so environments without the
 *   key (local dev, self-hosters) do not break. To activate, configure the
 *   SAME key on the cloud API Worker and the provisioning daemon — the same
 *   deployment requirement tenant-DB DSN encryption (`user-database.ts`)
 *   already imposes.
 *
 * Platform-managed control-plane tokens (`RESERVED_PLATFORM_ENV_KEYS` plus the
 * legacy `ELIZAOS_API_KEY` alias) are NEVER encrypted: the control plane reads
 * them synchronously outside the materialization path (bridge auth headers,
 * the dedicated-agent proxy, pairing routes), and they are minted and owned by
 * the platform — they are not user BYO secrets.

 * `SENSITIVE_ENV_KEY_PATTERN` matches the substring `TOKEN` in its NAME. Left
 * encryptable it makes the flag the single at-rest ciphertext on every agent
