/**
 * DB-backed pending-charge + settlement ledger for Tier-2 optimistic inference
 * billing (#9899) — the documented "next step" that closes the at-scale residuals
 * a KV-only backstop cannot:
 *
 *   - **Hard concurrent-overdraw bound.** Admission runs inside a transaction that
 *     first takes a per-org advisory lock (`pg_advisory_xact_lock`), THEN reads the
 *     org balance + the SUM of its still-`pending` charges and inserts a `pending`
 *     row only if `balance > threshold AND balance - in-flight >= estimate`. The
 *     advisory lock serializes admissions for one org, so each reads the in-flight
 *     SUM only after any concurrent admission has COMMITTED (READ COMMITTED takes a
 *     fresh snapshot per statement) — a burst can never collectively overdraw. A
 *     bare `FOR UPDATE` on the org row is NOT enough: the in-flight SUM scans a
 *     different table and would read a stale MVCC snapshot, so two admissions would
 *     both see the same pre-insert SUM and both admit (the bug the advisory lock
 *     fixes; single-connection PGlite masks it, real Postgres does not).
 *   - **Exactly-once settlement, crash-safe.** The claim (`UPDATE … SET
 *     status='settled' WHERE status='pending'`) and the actual debit run in ONE
 *     transaction. Only one of {inline settler, cron sweep} can win the `pending`
 *     transition (exactly-once), and because claim+debit commit together a crash
 *     between them ROLLS BACK the claim — the row stays `pending` and the sweep
 *     recovers it (no lost charge), and no other transaction ever observes a
 *     "claimed-but-not-debited" state (no over-admit window).
 *   - **Age-ordered sweep drain.** The cron drains oldest-pending-first via an
 *     indexed `ORDER BY enqueued_at` cursor, looping batches until empty, and GCs
 *     terminal rows past a retention window so the table cannot grow unbounded.
 *
 * The debit is replicated here (the same atomic `FOR UPDATE` balance guard +
 * `credit_transactions` row as `creditsService.reserveAndDeductCredits`) so it can
 * run INSIDE the claim transaction — `deductCredits` cannot take an external
 * transaction. A debit the DB refuses (`credit_balance >= 0` CHECK) marks the row
 * `uncollected` (auditable) and the org self-heals onto the synchronous-reserve
 * path on its next admission (the slow path re-engages low-credit / auto-top-up
 * notifications). Cache invalidation fires post-commit.
 *
 * Selected by `INFERENCE_BILLING_LEDGER="db"` (default `kv` = the existing backstop
 * in `inference-billing-fast-path.ts`); both are gated behind
 * `INFERENCE_OPTIMISTIC_BILLING`. See `packages/cloud/api/docs/inference-hot-path.md`.
