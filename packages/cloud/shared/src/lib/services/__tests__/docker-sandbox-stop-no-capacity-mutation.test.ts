/**
 * `DockerSandboxProvider` stop is remote-teardown-only (#17185).
 *
 * The provider used to decrement `docker_nodes.allocated_count` at the end of
 * every stop. That made local capacity arithmetic a side effect of a RETRYABLE
 * remote operation which treats "already gone" as success — so each retry after
 * a post-stop failure freed another slot, and the slot it freed belonged to a
 * live sibling on that node. Ownership of the counter moved to the caller's
 * deletion generation; the provider must now never touch it, on ANY outcome.
 *
 * Drives the real `DockerSandboxProvider` with only the SSH transport scripted
 * (the seam the issue names) and the container meta pre-seeded in memory, so the
 * real classification logic — already-absent, unreachable-abandon, genuine
 * failure — decides each path. `decrementAllocated` is spied, never stubbed out
 * of existence: the assertion is that the real method is never reached.
