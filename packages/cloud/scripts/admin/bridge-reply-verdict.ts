/**
 * Pass/fail classifier for a cloud-bridge `message.send` reply, shared by the
 * live e2e chat scripts (hetzner-e2e-chat.ts, live-cloud-provision-smoke.ts).
 *
 * The agent runtime answers HTTP 200 with canned text when its model path is
 * dead — "Sorry, I'm having a provider issue", credits-depleted, rate-limited,
 * no-provider — tagged with a `failureKind` discriminator that the bridge
 * propagates (#15616). The bridge itself fabricates text (`fallback: true`),
 * the cloud-agent image echoes the prompt when @elizaos/core is missing
 * (`[echo] …` — which would even contain the proof token), and the shared
 * runtime marks designed-unavailable turns `degraded: true`. A smoke pass must
 * mean a real model round-trip, so every one of those shapes is a failure here:
 * the structured flags are the primary signal and the canned-string list is
 * belt-and-braces for runtimes that predate `failureKind`.
 *
 * The canned strings mirror packages/agent/src/api/chat-routes.ts,
 * packages/core/src/services/message/fallback-reply.ts, and the bridge
 * fallback in packages/cloud/shared/src/lib/services/eliza-sandbox.ts. They are
 * duplicated (not imported) so these scripts stay runnable with plain `bun run`
 * on a CI box without a workspace build.
