# Hetzner Agent E2E

Nightly end-to-end smoke that provisions a real Hetzner cpx22 server,
deploys a trivial agent via the Eliza Cloud staging API, runs a
bridge-ping healthcheck plus one real chat turn (a `message.send`
JSON-RPC through the production Worker bridge path, requiring a reply
that echoes a per-run proof token and carries no fabrication flag),
and tears everything down. A reaper
workflow sweeps any servers older than 60 minutes every half hour as a
safety net.

Before allocation, the provisioner also removes older servers carrying both
`ci=true` and `workflow=hetzner-e2e`. The workflow concurrency group prevents
official E2E runs from overlapping, and malformed or untagged inventory entries
are never deletion candidates.

The workflow gracefully skips when secrets are unset, so it can land
on `develop` and be activated later by adding secrets. Once secrets
are present, the Cloud API auth preflight is a real gate: a 401/403
from `CLOUD_E2E_API_KEY` fails the run instead of reporting a skip,
because an invalid key would otherwise hide provisioning regressions.

## One-time setup

### 1. Create a CI-scoped Hetzner project + token

1. Create a separate Hetzner Cloud project (so a leaked token can't
   touch production servers).
2. Issue a read-write API token in that project.
3. Generate a fresh `ed25519` SSH keypair locally (not your dev key):
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f /tmp/hetzner-e2e-key -N ""
   ```
4. Upload the public key to the Hetzner project (Hetzner Console →
   Security → SSH Keys) and record the **numeric key id** from the
   URL.

### 2. Create the GitHub environment

In the repo settings, create a new environment named
`ci-hetzner-e2e`. (Restricting to `develop` is recommended.)

### 3. Add environment secrets

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `HCLOUD_TOKEN_CI` | The Hetzner API token from step 1.2 |
| `CLOUD_E2E_API_KEY` | A long-lived Eliza Cloud staging bearer token |
| `CI_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` | Contents of `/tmp/hetzner-e2e-key` (private) |
| `CI_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY_ID` | Numeric Hetzner SSH key id from step 1.4 |

## Estimated cost

Default `cpx22` in `fsn1` is a shared 2 vCPU / 4 GB server. A nightly run that
lives ~10 minutes is **about $0.30–$1.00/month** depending on
healthcheck duration. The reaper enforces a 60-minute upper bound so
the worst case (a stuck workflow) is bounded at one server-hour per
run.

If the requested `HETZNER_E2E_SERVER_TYPE` is deprecated or not
offered at `HETZNER_E2E_LOCATION`, the provisioner falls back through
a short list of known-good shared-cpu `cpx22` locations, followed by `cpx11` in
`hil`, before giving up.

## Manual trigger / dry run

```bash
gh workflow run hetzner-e2e.yml
```

To test locally without touching Hetzner, run only the helpers that
don't make real API calls (e.g. typecheck them with `tsc --noEmit`).
**Do not** invoke `hetzner-e2e-provision.ts` outside of CI unless you
intend to create a real billable server.

  bridge-fabricated (`fallback: true`), runtime-canned (`failureKind`,
  known canned strings), or an `[echo]` parroting — so "provisioned
