# Reproducible Railway deploy for gateway-discord.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# The in-repo Dockerfile does `bun install --frozen-lockfile` against this
# package's own context, which can't resolve the `@elizaos/cloud-services-common`
# workspace:* dependency when `railway up` uploads only the package directory
# (no monorepo). `bun build` (the `build` script) DOES resolve + inline that dep
# from the monorepo, producing a self-contained bundle — so we build the bundle
# here and ship a runtime-only image.
#
# LONG-TERM FIX: reconnect the Railway service to the GitHub repo (Railway
# dashboard) so it auto-deploys on push as documented in railway.toml /
# .github/workflows/cloud-gateway-discord.yml, and/or make the Dockerfile build
# from the monorepo root. Until then, run this from the package directory:
#
#   railway link --project eliza-cloud --service gateway-discord --environment production
#   bun run scripts/deploy-railway.sh
#
# zlib-sync is intentionally omitted: it is an optional native dep of the Discord
# WS lib (lazy require -> graceful fallback to no compression).
