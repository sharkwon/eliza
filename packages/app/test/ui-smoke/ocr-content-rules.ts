/**
 * Pixel-truth content rules for the all-views audit: given OCR plus independent
 * pixel diagnostics from a captured view screenshot, decide whether the pixels
 * a user actually sees are healthy and match what the view is supposed to show.
 *
 * This closes the gap the DOM-derived metrics in `aesthetic-audit-rules.ts` can't
 * see. `readableChars` counts text in the DOM tree; it says nothing about what
 * painted. A view can carry a full DOM subtree and still render blank (white on
 * white, a collapsed flex child, a z-index'd overlay), leak a developer string
 * (`[object Object]`, `undefined`, an unresolved `{{token}}`), or simply be
 * missing the label it exists to show. Only the rendered pixels reveal those, and
 * the rules here operate on the OCR of those pixels.
 *
 * Kept dependency-free (no OCR engine, no `page`, no fs) so it unit-tests as pure
 * functions, mirroring how `aesthetic-audit-rules.ts` was extracted from its
 * Playwright spec. The CLI (`ocr-triage.ts`) and, in CI, the audit spec, supply
 * the OCR and consume the verdict.
