// Soft, non-flaky budgets. These intentionally have generous headroom so the
// spec doubles as a measurement rather than a brittle gate.
//
// Web-vitals (FCP/LCP) are the meaningful, production-faithful signals here.
//
// JS payload: this measures `encodedBodySize` of script resources, but it is
// NOT the production payload and is NOT the authoritative size gate:
//   - The ui-smoke live-stack server serves dist assets UNCOMPRESSED (verified
//     content-encoding: none); production serves brotli, so this raw transfer
//     runs ~2.7x larger than what users download.
//   - Once the shell reaches "ready" it fires requestIdleCallback ->
//     prefetchRouteViewChunks() (App.tsx), speculatively warming other routes'
//     lazy chunks. In the near-idle test page this fires before the composer
//     testid mounts, so the chat-route number folds in a build-dependent chunk
//     set and varies run-to-run / build-to-build.
// The authoritative compressed-payload gate is the brotli bundle KPI
// (loadperf bundle-kpi in https://github.com/elizaOS/benchmarks: eager first-paint ~1.43 MB
// brotli, total ~6.93 MB brotli — both PASS). The ceiling below is a coarse
// raw-transfer regression guard with limited headroom for the prefetch-warmed
// chunk set, so it still catches a genuinely runaway/duplicated graph while
// tolerating normal build variance. Track the reported FCP/LCP/JS numbers; they
// are the meaningful signal here.

    //     other route's lazy chunk. Sampling after that idle warm-up would
