// Ratchet gate for external-API mock validation.
//
// The keyless ui-smoke lane mocks external-API BFF endpoints with inline fixtures
// in test/ui-smoke/helpers.ts. A mock is only trustworthy when the plugin's BFF
// parser is validated against a REAL recorded provider response + a live drift
// check. The tier inventories below are the canonical contract.
//
// This gate enforces:
//   1. every API marked "validated" keeps its recorded-contract + live-drift tests
//      (file existence — they can't silently disappear), and
//   2. the unvalidated-debt set only shrinks (a ceiling that is the forcing
//      function to pay it down, mirroring the other coverage ratchets).
