/**
 * Host-external importers this app build contributes to `DynamicViewLoader`.
 *
 * `DynamicViewLoader`'s trunk map (in `@elizaos/ui`) is framework-only. Plugin
 * view bundles that import a plugin package (e.g. the health/finances views
 * importing `@elizaos/plugin-browser`) leave that specifier external and rely on the host
 * shell to resolve it to the host realm's singleton. This module — the app
 * (build-variant) entrypoint — registers those plugin-owned specifiers so the
 * shared UI package never has to name them.
 *
 * Registration runs synchronously at renderer module-eval (imported at the top
 * of `main.tsx`), before any view can navigate, so the importer is always in
 * the registry by the time a view bundle resolves its externals.
 *
 * Each thunk keeps the exact runtime shape the trunk map used: a `@vite-ignore`
 * bare-specifier dynamic import resolved against the host realm, so no plugin
 * package is pulled into the app's static graph.
 *
 * The view-bundle import guard (`packages/scripts/view-bundle-import-guard.mjs`)
 * scans this file's `registerHostExternalImporter("<specifier>", …)` calls, so
 * a specifier registered here is treated as loadable when validating built view
 * bundles. Add new host-external plugin specifiers here (or self-register from
 * the owning plugin's `register.ts`, adding it to the guard's scan set).
