# Pixel-truth OCR triage for the all-views audit

The aesthetic audit (`test/ui-smoke/all-views-aesthetic-audit.spec.ts`) captures a
screenshot of every view and scores it from the **DOM**: readable-char count,
color buckets, divider density, whitespace. Those metrics never see what actually
_painted_. A view can carry a full DOM subtree and still render blank, leak a
developer string a user should never read (`[object Object]`, `undefined`, an
unresolved `{{token}}`), or be missing the one label it exists to show — and the
DOM audit calls it `good`.

This stage reads the **pixels**. It OCRs each captured screenshot with the
packaged `tesseract.js` dependency, runs content rules over the recognized text,
and cross-checks the result against the DOM verdict already in `report.json`.
The OCR engine is installed by the normal workspace `bun install`; if it is
missing or cannot initialize, the gate fails instead of skipping the check.

OCR silence is not proof of blank pixels. The shared evidence primitive first
runs whole-page OCR and retains its transcript and mean confidence. A weak pass
(fewer than two words or below 45% confidence) gets one deterministic retry:
the image is enlarged up to 3×/2400 px, converted to normalized grayscale,
sharpened, thresholded at 225, and read with sparse-text segmentation. The raw
transcript/confidence for both attempts and the selected mode are written to the
triage report. Separately, downsampled pixel analysis proves blank frames only
when they have no opaque samples or a single quantized color. Low-confidence OCR
on a visually populated frame is `needs-eyeball`, never “pixels are blank.”

This split is load-bearing for icon-heavy mobile launchers (#16327). On the
390×844 reproduction, default packaged Tesseract returned only `oY)` at 40%
confidence. The high-contrast sparse pass recovered 49 words at 72% confidence,
including the launcher labels, while pixel analysis measured 210 color buckets
and a 33.7% dominant-color ratio. A slug exemption would also hide a truly blank
launcher; the evidence-driven split keeps that failure armed.

## What it produces

- **Verifications** — a view whose pixels contain every label it's supposed to
  show earns a positive `verified`, retiring it from the manual `needs-eyeball`
  pile instead of leaving a human to squint at it.
- **Semantic exemptions** — a platform-gated or unregistered-bundle surface
  remains visibly `needs-eyeball` with a durable reason. Its observable browser
  fallback is still asserted, and a newly loaded remote bundle invalidates the
  exemption instead of inheriting it silently.
- **Regressions** — a view the DOM audit passed (`good`/`needs-eyeball`) whose
  pixels are broken: blank paint, a developer-string leak, an unresolved
  placeholder, or a missing required label. These are the bugs the DOM metrics
  structurally cannot see (a crash caught by an error boundary and _rendered_
  moves neither `consoleErrors` nor `readableChars`).

## Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `scripts/mvp-visual-verify/ocr.mjs` | Shared OCR engine and pixel-diagnostic exports. Prefers packaged `tesseract.js`, with an explicit system `tesseract` fallback for debugging. |
| `test/ui-smoke/ocr-content-rules.ts` | Pure, dependency-free verdict rules (proven blank / inconclusive OCR / dev-string / placeholder / expectation). Unit-tested; no OCR engine, no `page`, no fs. |
| `test/ui-smoke/ocr-view-expectations.ts` | Closed per-view semantic policy table: required/forbidden labels from stable view contracts, plus narrowly typed exemptions with fallback assertions. |
| `test/ui-smoke/aesthetic-audit-view-cases.ts` | Shared built-in and plugin route registry consumed by capture and policy-coverage tests. |
| `test/ui-smoke/ocr-triage-baseline.json` | `slug::viewport` of pixel-broken renders already tracked by an issue. Ratchet posture: known debt is reported but non-gating; a NEW pixel-broken render fails the gate. |
| `scripts/ocr-triage.ts` | CLI: OCRs a capture dir, applies the rules, cross-checks `report.json`, writes `ocr-triage.json`, exits non-zero on a new regression. |
| `test/audit/ocr-content-rules.test.ts` | Unit tests for the rules module. |

## Run

```bash
# After an audit run has populated aesthetic-audit-output/ (screenshots + report.json):
bun scripts/ocr-triage.ts \
  --audit-dir aesthetic-audit-output \
  --baseline test/ui-smoke/ocr-triage-baseline.json

# Reuse a precomputed OCR pass instead of re-running OCR:
bun scripts/ocr-triage.ts --audit-dir <dir> --ocr <ocr.ndjson> --baseline <file>
```

Exit `0` when no new regression; `1` when a view regressed off the baseline. Wire
the invocation into the audit lane after the Playwright capture so a new
pixel-broken render fails CI the way a new DOM `broken` already does.

## Adding a view policy

Add an entry to `VIEW_OCR_POLICIES` keyed by the capture slug. Labels must come
from durable component chrome or a deterministic audit fixture, not from the OCR
transcript being judged. Prefer distinctive labels and use `requireAny` only for
designed state alternatives. The registry coverage test fails if a captured slug
has no policy or a retired slug remains in the table.

Use `semantic-exemption` only when the browser capture structurally cannot own
the view semantics: a native-only surface or a plugin with no registered remote
bundle. State the reason, declare the exact fallback labels, and choose the typed
applicability. An unregistered-bundle exemption fails as soon as capture reports
bundle provenance, forcing a real semantic expectation for the newly observable
surface.

## Baseline discipline

A `slug::viewport` goes in the baseline only with an accompanying issue link in
the file's `tracking` map. Removing an entry once the render is fixed re-arms the
gate for that view. Never baseline a new regression to make CI green — that is the
one move the ratchet exists to prevent.
