# Eliza-1 training and publishing

Training, evaluation, quantization, and publication contract for Eliza-1.
Repository-wide rules come from the root [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md); native
runtime and ABI rules come from
[`plugin-local-inference/native/CLAUDE.md`](../../plugins/plugin-local-inference/native/CLAUDE.md).

This file is the canonical contract for training, quantization,
evaluation, and HuggingFace publishing of the Eliza-1 model line. It
applies to everything under `packages/training/`.

## Locked targets

- **REAL model:** `elizaos/eliza-1-2b` (the actual artifact we ship and
  fine-tune against). All RL configs target this — see
  `config/atropos.yaml`, `config/tinker.yaml`.
- **EVAL judge:** `cerebras/gpt-oss-120b` (RLAIF judge for trajectory
  scoring; reached via LiteLLM in both atropos and tinker configs).
- **TESTING HARNESS:** Nebius (OpenAI-compatible inference endpoint
  used for rollouts during RL — `NEBIUS_BASE_URL`, `NEBIUS_API_KEY`).
- **Continuous RL data:** on-disk JSONL exports under
  `${ELIZA_STATE_DIR}/trajectories/`, written by the eliza native trajectory
  recorder. The state dir resolves (see `packages/core/src/utils/state-dir.ts`)
  as `ELIZA_STATE_DIR` → `$XDG_STATE_HOME/eliza` → `~/.local/state/eliza` — NOT
  `~/.eliza/state`. No database dependency.
  - **Recording gate (`resolveTrajectoryGate`,
    `packages/core/src/runtime/trajectory-gate.ts`):** capture is **opt-in in
    `NODE_ENV=production` and `test`, default-on in dev/unset**. Precedence,
    first match wins: `ELIZA_DISABLE_TRAJECTORY_LOGGING=1` (hard off) →
    `ELIZA_TRAJECTORY_LOGGING` (canonical truthy/falsey knob; blank =
    unset) → legacy `ELIZA_TRAJECTORY_RECORDING` alias → the `NODE_ENV`
    default. To collect RL data in prod/test you must set
    `ELIZA_TRAJECTORY_LOGGING=1`; the scenario runner sets it automatically.

Do not edit configs to point at non-Gemma base names or OpenAI judges —
the lock above is the product contract.


The inference-side companion contract lives in the inference package.
**Read it first if it exists.** The product mandates (three runtime modes,
mandatory optimizations, fused pipeline, manifest schema, HF publishing
flow, verification gates) live there, and this file does not repeat them.
This file describes what training has to *do* to satisfy that contract.

## 1. What this package owns

- Text fine-tuning of the Gemma 4 (E2B / E4B / 12B / 31B)
  backbones used by the current Eliza-1 release line.
- Drafter training for MTP speculative decoding.
- Voice handling (freeze, cache, evaluate — see §4; we do not retrain
  voice weights right now).
- Quantization recipes that produce shippable Eliza-1 artifacts:
  TurboQuant, QJL, PolarQuant, plus the fused TurboQuant pipeline.
- Eval harness for text, voice, and end-to-end voice loop.
- HuggingFace publishing of bundles to `elizaos/eliza-1` under
  `bundles/<tier>/`.
- Dataset preparation, deslop, and validation.

This package does NOT own:

- The runtime engine, downloader, or routing — those are in
  `packages/app-core/` (see `packages/app-core/scripts/` for build hooks).
- The build hook or kernel patches — that is
  `packages/app-core/scripts/build-llama-cpp-mtp.mjs`.

---

## 2. What we train, what we freeze

Per the inference contract (and the user mandate that weights remain
unchanged for now):

| Component       | Status                                        | Why                                  |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Text backbone   | **Fine-tune** (Gemma 4 E2B / E4B)             | This is the primary product loop.    |
| MTP drafter  | **Fine-tune to match the text checkpoint**    | Acceptance rate depends on alignment.|
| OmniVoice TTS   | **Frozen**                                    | No license to retrain; no eval lift. |
| ASR             | **Frozen**                                    | Same.                                |
| Vision (mmproj) | **Frozen** unless the text backbone moves     | Tied to backbone visual layers.      |

When the text backbone version bumps, the drafter must be retrained
to match. The publish script MUST refuse to bundle a drafter whose
training run did not target the same text-checkpoint hash recorded in
its metadata.

OmniVoice singing weights can ship in default Eliza-1 bundles under the
current non-commercial open-source mandate. The prior research-only gate
is lifted; if the project pivots to commercial licensing, the CC-BY-NC-SA
training-data lineage must be re-evaluated before any commercial bundle
is published.

---

## 3. Quantization (recipe reality)

Quantization is not optional for Eliza-1, but the active Gemma release
line does not use the old fused Qwen-style recipe stack as its shipping
weight artifact. The shipping Gemma weight quant is stock
`llama-quantize` Q4_K_M produced through
`scripts/quantization/gguf-q4_k_m_apply.py` from the canonical fork at
`plugins/plugin-local-inference/native/llama.cpp`. Higher-quality ladder
rungs (`Q6_K`, `Q8_0`) are produced the same way when a tier explicitly
requires them.

Recipe roles, as implemented:

| Recipe | What it actually changes | Entry point |
| ------ | ------------------------ | ----------- |
| GGUF K-quant | Weight tensors in the produced GGUF (`Q4_K_M` today for shipping Gemma) | `scripts/quantization/gguf-q4_k_m_apply.py` |
| TurboQuant | Runtime KV-cache compressor for V-cache blocks; weights are unchanged | `scripts/quantization/turboquant_apply.py` / `fused_turboquant_apply.py` |
| QJL | Runtime K-cache compressor with JL projection geometry; weights are unchanged | `scripts/quantization/qjl_apply.py` |
| PolarQuant | Weight quantizer for `nn.Linear` tensors, emitting reconstructed weights plus `polarquant_artifacts.safetensors`; not a Gemma default release gate today | `scripts/quantization/polarquant_apply.py` |
| TCQ | Long-context TurboQuant K-cache type (`turbo3_tcq`); weights are unchanged | `scripts/quantization/turboquant_apply.py --trellis` |

TurboQuant is a runtime KV-cache compressor. QJL is a runtime K-cache compressor.
PolarQuant is a weight quantizer. Do not describe
TurboQuant as weight quantization or PolarQuant as a KV-cache pass.

Hard rules:

- A sidecar is provenance only for a recipe that actually ran against
  the artifact or is explicitly enabled for that tier. Sidecar presence
  alone is not proof. A recipe that is not applied to a tier MUST NOT
  contribute `recipeManifest` metadata for that tier.
- Every applied recipe MUST emit a quantization manifest fragment
  consumed by the inference manifest builder. The fragment records:
  kernel target, block layout version, real source-content sha256,
  expected per-block tolerance, and target class (`weights` or
  `kv-cache`).
- Every applied recipe MUST run its real-artifact test before exit. For
  the shipping Q4_K_M path, `gguf-q4_k_m_apply.py` runs a
  `llama-cli` load-smoke against the produced GGUF and refuses to write
  a release-suitable sidecar when it fails. A failing test is a
  publish-blocking error.
- If a recipe is asked to run on weights or cache geometry that do not
  satisfy its preconditions (wrong layer count, wrong dtype, missing
  rotation, unsupported layer type, missing converter/kernel), it MUST
  fail loudly. No silent passes, no skip-and-continue.

Gemma note: QJL/PolarQuant are low-ROI on Gemma 4's already-minimal KV
(MQA + windowed-SWA + shared-KV), so the KV-cache QJL/TurboQuant passes
and PolarQuant weight path are optional-and-currently-unused on Gemma
release tiers unless a tier explicitly opts in and carries real
recipe-test evidence.

The reference implementations and on-device kernels live in
`plugins/plugin-local-inference/native/{reference,verify}` and
`packages/native/plugins/{qjl-cpu,polarquant-cpu}`. The Python recipes here
MUST stay byte-for-byte compatible with those references — when a
recipe's block layout, codebook, or sign-vector seed changes, the
references, kernels, and `_kernel_manifest.py` sha256 pins must be
updated in lockstep, in the same PR.

## 4. Voice freeze + cache pipeline

We do not retrain voice. We do build artifacts that make voice mode
fast at runtime:

1. **Speaker preset extraction.** The default speaker embedding is
   computed once during publish and stored as
   `cache/voice-preset-default.bin` in the bundle. The runtime loads
   it directly; it does NOT re-extract from raw audio at startup.
2. **Phrase cache seed.** A small set of common assistant phrases
   ("Sure.", "One moment.", "I can't help with that.", a few dozen
   total) is pre-synthesized at publish time, encoded as PCM seeds,
   and stored alongside the speaker preset. The runtime warms the
   phrase cache from this seed; first-byte latency for these phrases
   approaches zero.
3. **Voice eval.** RTF (real-time factor), MOS proxy, ASR-roundtrip
   WER, and barge-in cancel latency are measured at publish time and
   recorded in the manifest's `evals.voiceRtf` block.

Frozen-voice rule: any change to voice weights, OmniVoice C++ source
vendor pin, or speaker preset format MUST bump the voice section's
manifest version and re-run all voice evals. A bundle whose voice
section version differs from the eval blob's recorded version is
broken — refuse to publish.

---

## 5. Pipeline entry points

These scripts under `packages/training/scripts/` are the canonical
entry points for training and publishing:

- `run_pipeline.py` — top-level training pipeline (text fine-tune).
- `train_local.py` / `train_dpo.py` / `train_grpo_verl.sh` — local /
  DPO / GRPO training entry points.
- `cloud_run.py` / `train_vast.sh` / `train_nebius.sh` — cloud training
  dispatchers.
- `quantization/*_apply.py` — quantization recipes (see §3).
- `quantization/gguf_eliza1_apply.py` — release GGUF conversion/verification
  helper for the supported Gemma bundle path. It is not invoked through the
  retired `eliza1-optimized` optimizer.
- `eval_checkpoint.py` / `eval_loop.sh` / `benchmarks/` — eval harness.
- `publish/publish_model.py` / `publish/publish_dataset.py` /
  `publish/publish_pipeline.py` — three canonical publisher entry points.
  `publish_model` dispatches to `publish.orchestrator` (full gated bundle
  publish) or `publish_eliza1_model_repo` (per-tier upload after the full gate
  ran elsewhere). `publish_all_eliza1.sh` is the per-tier matrix driver. These MUST be the
  *only* paths that push app-facing bundles to `elizaos/eliza-1`. The older
  `publish_pipeline_to_hf.py` publishes the training pipeline source to HF Hub
  (not production model bundles); `push_model_to_hf.py` redirects callers to
  the canonical entry points.
- `inference/serve_local.py` / `inference/serve_vllm.py` — eval-time
  serving harnesses (not production runtime — that is app-core).

When adding a new pipeline stage, prefer extending the existing
`run_pipeline.py` graph over inventing a parallel entry point. The
goal is one canonical command that goes from raw checkpoint to
published bundle.

## 6. Publishing to HuggingFace

Every Eliza-1 bundle published to `elizaos/eliza-1/bundles/<tier>` MUST go
through `publish_all_eliza1.sh` (or the per-tier publish script it
calls). That script:

1. Assembles files matching the bundle layout contract.
2. Runs every quantization recipe required for the tier.
3. Calls `make -C ../../plugins/plugin-local-inference/native/verify reference-test` and the
   relevant `metal_verify` / `vulkan_verify` runs against the
   quantized artifacts. **Hardware verification is required.**
4. Runs the eval harness: text-eval, voice-rtf, e2e-loop, 30-turn.
5. Generates `eliza-1.manifest.json` from the verification + eval
   results.
6. Generates `README.md` in the HF repo from the manifest (do not
   hand-edit the README on the HF side).
7. Pushes weights, manifest, README, licenses, and eval blobs.
8. Tags the local training repo with the released bundle ID +
   training commit hash.

Publish-blocking conditions (the script MUST exit non-zero):

- Any required kernel verification missing or failing on a backend
  the tier supports.
- Any required eval failing its tier-specific gate.
- Any quantization recipe test failing.
- Manifest schema validation failure.
- License blob missing or stale.

There is no "publish anyway with `defaultEligible: false`" path during
normal release. That flag is only set false by automated systems when
a previously-good bundle is later flagged broken — the act of *first
publishing* always requires green.

---

## 7. Datasets, deslop, validation

- Dataset preparation and deslop scripts already exist
  (`build_v2_corpus.py`, the `transform_*.py` family, `deslop_eval_splits.sh`,
  `validate_corpus.py`). The privacy filter is mandatory on every
  write path that touches real user trajectories — repo-wide
  `CLAUDE.md` enforces this; do not bypass.
- Native-tool-calling data prep is `prepare_native_tool_calling_data.py`
  with the schema at `config/native_tool_calling_record.schema.json`.
  Tool-calling cache optimization is part of the runtime contract;
  training data should match the cache-friendly call shape.
- New corpora MUST run through `validate_corpus.py` and the schema
  validators before being included in a training run. No raw scrape
  to fine-tune in one step.

---

## 8. Evaluation gates (per tier)

Every Eliza-1 publish MUST record these in the manifest's `evals`
block. Tier-specific gate values live in
`packages/training/benchmarks/` and are versioned alongside the
training pipeline:

- **Text quality.** Held-out eval at the bundle's quantized weights.
  No "evaluated at fp16, shipped at Q3" results.
- **Voice RTF.** Real-time factor under the bundle's quantization,
  measured on representative target hardware per tier (mobile tiers
  on actual phones, desktop on actual Macs/PCs, not just on a server).
- **ASR WER.** Transcription word-error rate on the standard eval set.
- **End-to-end voice loop.** Mic → ASR → text → TTS round trip,
  measuring first-token latency, first-audio latency, barge-in cancel
  latency, and 30-turn endurance.
- **MTP acceptance rate.** Drafter token acceptance against the
  shipped target. A drafter whose acceptance rate drops below the
  tier's gate is publish-blocking.
- **Memory + thermal (mobile only).** Peak RSS under the bundle's
  context-length variants; thermal/battery profile across a 10-minute
  voice session.

The tier-specific gate values are part of the contract — changing a
gate means bumping the eval schema version and rebaselining every
shipped bundle.

---

## 9. Working style

- **Scope discipline.** Don't add a new training stage, a new dataset,
  or a new quantization recipe without checking what already exists
  under `scripts/`. The directory listing is large; reuse beats
  reinventing.
- **No defensive code.** Failing precondition checks, failing tests,
  failing eval gates are loud errors. Don't catch-and-continue. The
  whole point of the publish gate is that broken bundles never ship.
- **Reproducibility.** Every training run produces a manifest that
  records: dataset hashes, tokenizer hash, base-checkpoint hash,
  hyperparameters, training commit. The drafter's manifest records
  its target text checkpoint's hash.
- **Bit-exact with kernels.** When a quantization recipe and a kernel
  reference disagree, the kernel reference
  (`packages/native/plugins/{qjl-cpu,polarquant-cpu}`) is canonical.
  Update the recipe to match, not the other way around.
- **Branding.** Published HF repos and READMEs say `Eliza-1`. Internal
  training logs, dataset names, and source-checkpoint references may
  use upstream names — but anything users see (the HF README, the
  bundle name, the model card) says Eliza-1 and records lineage in
  the manifest, not in the marketing copy.

## 10. Files to read before making changes

- `packages/training/README.md` — pipeline overview.
- `packages/training/docs/FINETUNING_PIPELINE.md` — finetuning pipeline
  reference.
- `packages/training/scripts/cloud/README.md` — cloud training
  operational reference (Vast, Nebius dispatch).
- `packages/training/scripts/quantization/README.md` — recipe-level
  reference.
- Root `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` — repo-wide conventions and cleanup
  mandate.

## Verification

Follow the repository-wide verification and evidence standard in the [root CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md). Run
the package's relevant build, typecheck, lint, and test commands, then exercise
the real integration boundary changed by the work. Inspect the produced domain
artifacts and failure behavior; do not substitute mocked success for the system
under test.
