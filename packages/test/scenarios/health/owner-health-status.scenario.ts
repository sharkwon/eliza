/**
 * Keyless per-plugin e2e for `@elizaos/plugin-health` (issue #8801).
 *
 * `plugin-health` ships no registered agent action of its own — its action
 * surface is a set of host-adapted factories (`createOwnerHealthAction` /
 * `createHealthActionRunner`) that `@elizaos/plugin-personal-assistant` wires
 * into the `OWNER_HEALTH` umbrella action (today | trend | by_metric | status).
 * Exercising plugin-health therefore means routing `OWNER_HEALTH` through the
 * deterministic LLM proxy with zero credentials and asserting the health
 * factory's handler runs and succeeds.
 *
 * The `status` op is the keyless-clean path: it reads the local health-backend
 * detection (`detectHealthBackend` -> `none` with no connector configured) and
 * reports "no bridge available" without any network call, OAuth token, device
 * bridge, or DB row. The host re-voices the canonical fallback through one
 * `TEXT_SMALL` grounded-reply call, which the proxy answers deterministically.
 *
 * Loading `@elizaos/plugin-personal-assistant` (the OWNER_HEALTH host) +
 * `@elizaos/plugin-scheduling` (its declared runner dependency) mirrors the
 * existing `deterministic-lifeops-scheduled-tasks` keyless scenario.
