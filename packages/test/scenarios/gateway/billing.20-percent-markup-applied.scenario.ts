Please reply in the thread if anything changes, because I need a clean handoff, a stable agenda, and no surprises before the meeting starts. I am intentionally keeping this note detailed so the Twilio SMS spans multiple segments, exercises the markup path, and leaves a clear audit trail for billing. Add that the backup approval path is the same as last week, the escalation contact is still Sam, the summary needs to include the delta from the morning notes, and the final send should happen only after we confirm the exact recipient and time window."',
