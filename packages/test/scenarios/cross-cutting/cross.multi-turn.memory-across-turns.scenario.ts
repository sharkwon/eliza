/**
 * Multi-turn memory: the agent is told a fact, then asked about it on a
 * later turn. The response to turn 2 must recall the fact from turn 1.
 *
 * De-echoed for #9310: the old recall assertion ("blue") also appeared in
 * the turn-1 text, so a reply that parroted conversation history passed
 * without any recall. Turn 2 now asks for the color's name in Spanish —
 * answering requires recalling "blue" from turn 1 AND producing "azul", a
 * token that appears in no user turn; a planted decoy color must not leak.
