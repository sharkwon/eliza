/**
 * Closes the gap from the lifeops audit (`docs/audits/lifeops-2026-05-09/
 * 03-coverage-gap-matrix.md` line 444 + #67): `paymentsAction` had no scenario.
 *
 * The companion `payments.agent-charge-five-dollar.scenario.ts` covers the
 * Cloud-app charge surface (`CREATE_APP_CHARGE`); this scenario covers the
 * lifeops `PAYMENTS` umbrella's dashboard read path. Owner asks "how am I
 * spending" → planner should route to PAYMENTS with mode=dashboard or
 * spending_summary, and the result data must contain the composite
 * dashboard payload (sources + spending + recurring) so the agent has the
 * facts it needs to summarize.
