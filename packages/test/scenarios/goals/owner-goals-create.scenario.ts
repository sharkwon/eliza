/**
 * Keyless per-plugin e2e for `@elizaos/plugin-goals` (issue #8801).
 *
 * The goals plugin's primary agent-action surface is `OWNER_GOALS`
 * (create | update | delete | review). This drives the create path end-to-end
 * through the deterministic LLM proxy with zero credentials: routing fixtures
 * select the action, a TEXT_LARGE fixture answers the action's own
 * `resolveActionArgs` extraction with a structured `{action, params}` envelope,
 * and the goal is created. The one PA-owned audit table the create path appends
 * to (`app_lifeops.life_audit_events`) is provisioned in the seed so the full
 * create->reply loop runs without pulling all of personal-assistant into the
 * keyless runtime (mirrors plugin-goals' own goals.harness.test.ts).
