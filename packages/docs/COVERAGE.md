# Documentation Coverage Matrix

This file maps every package under `packages/` to its docs-site coverage. Maintained as a contract: when a new user-facing package lands, add it here and add a doc page. When a package is deliberately internal, list it under "Intentionally omitted" with a one-line reason.

## Covered (user-facing)

| Package                          | Dimension | Primary doc surface                                                  |

## Intentionally omitted (internal)

| `packages/examples/`                   | Reference snippets; linked from track pages, not separately indexed.|

## Contract

- Every package that lands in `packages/` must have an entry here within the same PR.
- If the package is user-facing, the PR adds a doc page (or extends an existing one) and updates the table above.
- If the package is internal, the PR adds a one-line justification under "Intentionally omitted."
- The `bun test packages/docs/test` test suite verifies nav integrity.
- `npx mintlify broken-links` verifies no dead in-docs links.
