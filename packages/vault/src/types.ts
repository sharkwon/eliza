/**
 * Public types for @elizaos/vault.
 *
 * The vault holds two kinds of things keyed by a string:
 *   - sensitive values (API keys, tokens, private keys) — encrypted at rest
 *   - non-sensitive values (config: theme, model preferences, flags) — plaintext
 *
 * The same `set/get/has/describe/list/remove` API serves both; the caller
 * declares sensitivity at write time. Reads don't need to know.
