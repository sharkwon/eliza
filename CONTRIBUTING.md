# Contributing

Contribute through issues, project boards, discussions, and pull requests against
`develop`. The repository is agent-operated as well as human-maintained, so the
useful record is the one a reviewer can inspect later: scoped work, current
board state, linked code, and evidence that the real behavior happened.

## Start Work

Open an issue before non-trivial work. The issue owns the scope, acceptance
criteria, blockers, and evidence plan. Use the existing issue templates when
they fit:

- [Bug Report](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)
- [Feature Request](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md)
- [Agent Work Item](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/agent_work_item.md)

Branch from the latest `develop` with `feat/<slug>`, `fix/<slug>`,
`docs/<slug>`, or `chore/<slug>`. Always sync before opening or updating a PR:

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/develop
bun install
bun run verify
```

Keep package-local instructions in view. Read root `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`,
then the package-local `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` before touching that package.

## GitHub Projects

Issues are work cards. GitHub Projects are the live kanban state and ownership
record. Use fields already present on the active board before adding new ones.

Standard flow:

1. `Todo`: ready and unclaimed.
2. `Claimed`: an owner has committed to the card.
3. `In progress`: code, config, deployment, or shared state is actively being
   changed.
4. `Needs-agent-verify`: evidence is posted and another agent should check it.
5. `needs-human-verify`: agent verification is done or not applicable; a human
   needs to approve or test.
6. `Done`: only the managing human or maintainer moves cards here unless the
   board explicitly says otherwise.

When claiming a card, comment `CLAIMING: <scope>` on the issue, set the Project
`Claimed by` field to your lane or agent tag, and keep `Status` accurate. If the
work needs a shared lever such as production deploys, staging environments, DNS,
secrets, billing, or rollback authority, comment `CLAIMING LEVER: <thing>`
before touching it and release the lever when done.

Use Discussions for coordination, handoffs, multi-card questions, and noisy
status. Do not make a Discussion the only acceptance record for a task. Durable
decisions belong back in issue bodies, project readmes, `AGENTS.md`, or package
docs.

## Pull Requests

Every change ships through a PR against `develop`; do not push feature or fix
work straight to `develop`. Link the issue or Project card the PR resolves.
Keep PRs scoped to one coherent change. If a sweeping mechanical edit touches
many packages, explain why it is mechanical and keep package-specific behavior
changes out of the same PR.

The branch must be rebased on `origin/develop` before review. Resolve every
conflict, run the relevant package checks, and run `bun run verify` when the
change is ready for full validation.

## Contribution Provenance

Every AI-assisted contribution records the exact provider and model identifier
reported by the active runtime. The pull request body must preserve and complete
the `Contribution provenance` block from the repository template. Every
AI-authored issue comment, pull request comment, and review body must end with:

```text
AI provider/model: <provider> / <exact-model-id>
Client / agent tooling: <client>
Contribution skill revision: elizaOS/eliza@<full-commit-sha>:packages/skills/skills/contribute-to-eliza
Attribution status: self-reported
— [<lane-tag>]
<!-- eliza-computer-attribution:v1 {"provider":"<provider-slug>","model":"<exact-model-id>","client":"<client>","skill_revision":"elizaOS/eliza@<full-commit-sha>:packages/skills/skills/contribute-to-eliza"} -->
```

Do not infer or abbreviate the model, and do not substitute a model family such
as `GPT`, `Claude`, or `Gemini`. If the runtime cannot expose its exact provider
and model identifier, stop before posting and ask the operator to supply it.
The hidden marker contains valid JSON and matches the visible fields.
The lane signature is required immediately before the hidden marker.
AI-assisted issue bodies fill the visible provenance rows once, then append
only that signature and the matching marker at the end of the body; repeating
the visible footer fields is invalid. Human-only work says so explicitly in the
PR or issue template.

Attribution is self-reported provenance, not a verified attestation and not a
request for chain-of-thought. Never publish hidden reasoning, private prompts,
session IDs, credentials, access tokens, or other secrets as attribution.
When no generative model participated, say `no - human-only contribution` or
`no - deterministic workflow` and use a matching `None - <specific reason>` for
both model and client rows. Do not attribute deterministic automation to a
fictional model or describe it as human work.

New and edited `CLAIMING:`, `CLAIMING REVIEW:`, and `CLAIMING LEVER:` comments
on issues, pull requests, and Discussions are mechanically checked. New and
edited issue bodies are checked as well. A human claim with no AI assistance
ends with:

```text
AI assistance: no - human-only claim
Attribution status: self-reported
```

Ordinary human discussion does not need an attribution footer. Reviews and
comments that declare AI provenance are also checked for a terminal,
internally-consistent JSON marker; the public leaderboard reports missing or
invalid disclosure across every eligible non-bot source.

## Evidence

A reviewer must be able to confirm the real behavior without reading the code.
Attach complete, manually reviewed evidence inline in the issue or PR. Do not
commit evidence artifacts to the repository.

Required evidence by surface:

- UI changes: before and after full-page screenshots for desktop and mobile, an
  MP4 walkthrough of the full flow, frontend console and network logs, and
  backend logs when a server path fires.
- Agent, model, prompt, provider, or action changes: real live-model
  trajectories with inputs, outputs, tool calls, and results.
- Native, mobile, desktop, or device changes: per-platform screenshots,
  recordings, logs, and proof the installed build is current.
- Domain changes: the artifacts produced by the change, such as DB rows,
  memories, scheduled tasks, generated files, wallet balances, on-chain
  transaction hashes, audio, or device output.

If an evidence type does not apply, keep it visible in the PR and write
`N/A - <reason>`. Never leave evidence rows blank. Open every artifact yourself
before asking for review; capturing is not review.

**The gate is mechanical and fails closed.** `.github/workflows/pr.yaml` runs
`scripts/check-pr-evidence.mjs` on every PR: a blank/checkbox-only evidence row,
or a bare `N/A` with no reason, fails the check. A PR whose **diff touches a
rendered-UI source file** (a `.tsx`/`.css`/`.svg`/`.html` under `packages/app`,
`packages/ui`, `apps/app`, …) must attach **concrete** before/after screenshot,
walkthrough-video, and OCR-review artifacts — a link, not `N/A` — even when the
`ui`/`frontend`/`native` label is absent. Do not try to route around this by
dropping the label; fix the pipeline and capture the evidence.

**Before capturing, check your toolchain.** Run the doctor; it reports every
capture tool (tesseract, ffmpeg, Playwright browsers, GPU/Baidu OCR, Apple
Vision, VLM API keys, the claude/codex CLIs) and prints the exact install/start
command for anything missing. Install what it flags — a missing tool is a
fixable instruction, never a reason to ship without evidence.

### Install or repair the capture toolchain

From the repository root, one command installs or repairs the required
cross-platform capture dependencies and verifies their executable behavior:

```bash
bun run evidence:install-tools
```

The installer supports macOS with Homebrew, Windows with WinGet, and Linux with
apt-get, dnf, yum, apk, pacman, or zypper. It prefers healthy system or packaged
ffmpeg/ffprobe binaries instead of installing a redundant system copy, installs
the repository-pinned Playwright Chromium, and runs the strict doctor before it
returns success. Dependency bootstrap is locked and uses `--ignore-scripts`, so
it does not run unrelated repository postinstall or artifact-sync hooks.

Use `--github` to also install and execute the optional GitHub CLI; this does
not authenticate, persist credentials, change repository permissions, or prove
that a token can upload evidence. Use `--skip-deps` only when the locked
workspace dependencies are already installed. `--dry-run` prints the exact
argument-safe commands of the one resolved plan execution also consumes —
including the trailing strict doctor verification — without changing the host;
lines beginning `# assumes:` note where resolution depends on the dependency
step having run (packaged media binaries only resolve after `bun install`).
Add `--strict` to a dry run to fail when such assumptions remain. Every step
carries a deadline (15 minutes for package-manager operations, 2 minutes for
probes, 10 minutes for the doctor) so a wedged package manager or download
cannot block forever; multiply all deadlines on slow hosts with
`--timeout-scale=<factor>` or `ELIZA_EVIDENCE_INSTALL_TIMEOUT_SCALE`.

```bash
bun run evidence:install-tools -- --github
bun run evidence:install-tools -- --skip-deps
bun run evidence:install-tools -- --dry-run
bun run evidence:install-tools -- --dry-run --strict
bun run evidence:install-tools -- --timeout-scale=3
```

Package downloads, Playwright browser installation, and package-manager index
updates require network access. Linux system packages use root directly or
require a successful `sudo -n` preflight; the installer never prompts for a
password. Homebrew runs as the current user, while WinGet uses silent,
non-interactive agreement flags. A missing Homebrew, WinGet, or supported Linux
package manager is an explicit failure. Windows PATH refresh is local to the
installer process, and no supported platform path edits shell profiles or
developer configuration. Missing optional accelerators remain explicit
non-blocking doctor findings; missing required OCR, media, or browser
capabilities fail the strict doctor.

```bash
bun run evidence:doctor                   # human capability report
bun run evidence:doctor -- --strict       # fail if a required tool is missing
bun run evidence:doctor -- --strict --json  # normalized CI/operator report
```

**Visual verification is layered and always available.** OCR runs the GPU/Baidu
Unlimited-OCR engine when a vision server is up and falls back to tesseract
otherwise; heuristic checks add flat-color/palette and pixel-diff comparisons;
and structured VLM Q&A (`vision-qa`) reviews screenshots against explicit
questions. When no API key or local server is configured, set
`ELIZA_VISION_QA_BACKEND=cli` to review screenshots through an already-authed
`claude` or `codex` CLI (auto-detected by the doctor) — real token usage is
recorded, so the review is admissible evidence.

Useful commands:

```bash
# Real-LLM agent trajectories
packages/scenario-runner/bin/eliza-scenarios run <scenario.ts> --report <out.json>

# E2E UI recordings
bun run test:e2e:record:review

# Full matrix review bundle
bun run test:matrix:review

# App + cloud-UI screenshots; required for packages/app UI changes
bun run --cwd packages/app audit:app

# Native per-platform capture when a native/mobile/desktop surface changes
bun run --cwd packages/app capture:ios-sim -- --issue <n> --slug <s>
bun run --cwd packages/app capture:android-emu -- --issue <n> --slug <s>
bun run --cwd packages/app capture:linux-desktop -- --issue <n> --slug <s>
bun run --cwd packages/app capture:windows-desktop -- --issue <n> --slug <s>
```

Post videos as MP4 so GitHub renders them inline, screenshots as JPG where
possible, and long logs in a `<details>` block. Re-capture evidence after
rebasing when `develop` changes the behavior under review.

**Headless agents (no browser, cannot drag-and-drop):** upload media to the
dedicated [`pr-evidence` release](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/releases/tag/pr-evidence)
and embed the asset URLs — they end in a media extension, render inline via
`![](…)`, and satisfy the evidence gate. Prefer the one-command tool, which
also patches the PR rows and verifies the gate locally:

```bash
# name files <pr-number>-<artifact>.<ext>, then:
node scripts/pr-evidence.mjs attach 15171 15171-after-desktop.jpg 15171-walkthrough.mp4
# embed in the PR evidence rows:
#   ![after](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/releases/download/pr-evidence/15171-after-desktop.jpg)
```

GitHub caps a release at 1000 assets, so once `pr-evidence` fills, `attach`
rolls uploads into overflow releases (`pr-evidence-2`, `pr-evidence-3`, …) and
emits the URL of whichever release holds the asset. The gate accepts the whole
`pr-evidence`/`pr-evidence-N` family identically, so no manual tag juggling is
needed — always attach via the script rather than a raw `gh release upload`,
which fails once the target release is full.

Never delete assets referenced by an open PR. A worked example of a fully
evidenced PR (before/after screenshots, MP4 walkthroughs, OCR readout,
vision-QA trajectory with the model named, pixel-diff report, zero-error
frontend logs) is [#15171](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/15171).

## Security Reporting

The canonical security policy — reporting channel, disclosure window, and
remediation SLAs — is [`packages/docs/security.md`](packages/docs/security.md). In short: report
vulnerabilities privately to `security@elizalabs.ai`; do not open a public
GitHub issue for a live vulnerability, credential leak, exploit path, or
embargoed dependency issue. Include affected versions or commits, reproduction
steps, impact, and any safe proof of exploitability. Agents that encounter a
secret or suspected vulnerability must stop exposing details publicly and route
the finding to that mailbox or a maintainer-owned private channel.

Security, SOC2, and incident-response reference material lives under
[`packages/docs/security/`](packages/docs/security/). Package-specific security
implementation notes live in the relevant package docs.
