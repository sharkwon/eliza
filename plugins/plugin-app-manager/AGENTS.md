# @elizaos/plugin-app-manager

App lifecycle library for elizaOS: hosted-app discovery, launch, run-state tracking, and the `/api/apps/*` HTTP route surface. Extracted from `@elizaos/agent` in Phase 4G.

## Purpose / role

This package is **not** a `Plugin` object with actions/providers registered on `AgentRuntime`. It is a **library** that `@elizaos/agent` wires into its API server. It exports an `AppManager` service class and a `handleAppsRoutes` route handler. Together they power the apps surface: discovering registry apps, launching them (installing the plugin if needed), tracking active runs with heartbeat-based sweeping, and exposing REST endpoints consumed by the dashboard UI.

## Plugin surface

This package registers **no elizaOS plugin object**. It exports pure TypeScript symbols consumed by the host agent:

| Export | Kind | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `AppManager` | Class (service) | In-memory run registry with persistent JSON store. Manages launch, stop, attach, detach, heartbeat, and stale-run sweeping. |
| `handleAppsRoutes` | Function | HTTP route dispatcher for all `/api/apps/*` endpoints. Returns `Promise<boolean>` — `true` if handled, `false` if not matched. |
| `readAppRunStore` | Function | Read `runs.v2.json` from state dir, normalizing and migrating from v1. |
| `writeAppRunStore` | Function | Atomically write runs to `runs.v2.json`. |
| `resolveAppRunStoreFilePath` | Function | Returns absolute path to `<stateDir>/apps/runs.v2.json`. |
| `resolveLegacyAppRunStoreFilePath` | Function | Returns path to `<stateDir>/apps/runs.v1.json` (migration source). |
| `AppManagerLike` | Interface | Structural contract for `AppManager`; used by `handleAppsRoutes` so tests can substitute a mock. |
| `AppsRouteContext` | Interface | Context object `handleAppsRoutes` expects (request, response, helpers, app manager, plugin manager, favorites store, runtime). |
| `FavoriteAppsStore` | Interface | Read/write interface for persisted favorites; implementation lives in the host. |

## Route surface (`handleAppsRoutes`)

All routes are under `/api/apps/`:

| Method | Path | Description |

| GET | `/api/apps/favorites` | Read favorites list. |
| PUT | `/api/apps/favorites` | Toggle a single app's favorite state. |
| POST | `/api/apps/favorites/replace` | Bulk-replace favorites list. |
| GET | `/api/apps/runs` | List active runs (refreshes session state). |
| GET | `/api/apps/runs/:runId` | Get a single run (force-refreshes session). |
| GET | `/api/apps/runs/:runId/health` | Health facet of a run. |

| POST | `/api/apps/runs/:runId/control` | Proxy a control command into the app's route module. |

| GET | `/api/apps/plugins/search?q=` | Search non-app registry plugins. |
| POST | `/api/apps/refresh` | Force registry refresh. |
| GET | `/api/apps/permissions` | List all app permission views (requires `AppRegistryService`). |

| POST | `/api/apps/load-from-directory` | Register apps from a local directory scan. |
| POST | `/api/apps/create` | Invoke the `APP` runtime action in `create` mode. |

## Layout

```
src/
  index.ts                  Public exports (no Plugin object — just symbols)
  api/
    apps-routes.ts          handleAppsRoutes() + AppsRouteContext + AppManagerLike + FavoriteAppsStore
  services/
    app-manager.ts          AppManager class — launch / stop / runs / sweeper
    app-run-store.ts        readAppRunStore / writeAppRunStore / path helpers
```

## Commands

```bash
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-app-manager build       # compile to dist/
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-app-manager dev         # same as build (no watch)
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-app-manager typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-app-manager test        # vitest run --config vitest.config.ts
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-app-manager clean       # rm -rf dist
```

## Config / env vars

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ELIZA_ENABLE_LEGACY_APPS_WORKSPACE_DISCOVERY` | No | Set to `1`/`true` to also scan `apps/app-<slug>` dirs when resolving hero images (disabled by default). |

The state-dir path used by `readAppRunStore` / `writeAppRunStore` comes from `@elizaos/agent/config/paths#resolveStateDir`. Override it by passing the `stateDir` option to `new AppManager({ stateDir })`.

## How to extend

### Add a new REST endpoint

1. Open `src/api/apps-routes.ts`.
2. Add a new branch inside `handleAppsRoutes` matching on `method` and `pathname`.
3. Import any new Zod request schema from `@elizaos/shared` (keep the wire contract in shared, not here).
4. Add the new route to the route table above.

### Add a new AppManager method

1. Open `src/services/app-manager.ts`.
2. Add the method to the `AppManager` class.
3. Add the corresponding signature to `AppManagerLike` in `src/api/apps-routes.ts` so `handleAppsRoutes` can call it without importing `AppManager` directly.

### Add a new store field to run summaries

`AppRunSummary` is defined in `@elizaos/shared`. After updating the shared type, bump `APP_RUN_STORE_VERSION` in `src/services/app-run-store.ts` and update the `normalizeRun` function to read/migrate the new field.

## Conventions / gotchas

- **No Plugin object exported.** This package does not call `AgentRuntime.registerPlugin`. The host (`@elizaos/agent`) imports `AppManager` and `handleAppsRoutes` directly and wires them into its HTTP server.
- **AppManager is not a singleton.** The host constructs one instance and passes it through `AppsRouteContext`. Tests create their own instances with custom `stateDir` / `heartbeatTimeoutMs` / `heartbeatSweepIntervalMs` options.
- **Stale-run sweeper uses `unref()`.** Call `appManager.startStaleRunSweeper(getRuntime)` after construction; call `appManager.stopStaleRunSweeper()` on shutdown. The interval is `unref()`-ed so it does not keep the process alive.
- **Heartbeat is UI-driven.** The dashboard pings `POST /api/apps/runs/:runId/heartbeat` while `GameView` is mounted. When the tab closes, heartbeats stop and the sweeper reaps the run via the same `stopRun` hook as the explicit Stop button.
- **Template variable substitution.** App launch URLs and viewer URLs may contain `{KEY}` placeholders (e.g. `{BOT_NAME}`, `{RS_SDK_SERVER_URL}`). Only keys in `SAFE_APP_TEMPLATE_ENV_KEYS` are substituted. Unknown keys are preserved as-is for catalog display and stripped for launch.
- **URL safety.** `normalizeSafeAppUrl` rejects non-`http:`/`https:` protocols and protocol-relative `//` forms. Any launch or viewer URL that fails this check throws and aborts launch.
- **Run persistence.** Runs are written atomically to `<stateDir>/apps/runs.v2.json` via `writeJsonAtomicSync` after every mutation. On startup `AppManager` reads and normalizes existing runs (migrating from `runs.v1.json` if present).
- **Agents-list guard.** App launch must not replace the user's active character config. If `agents.list` in `eliza.config.json` changes during launch, it is restored via `shouldRestoreAgentsListAfterAppLaunch` (imported from `@elizaos/agent`).
- **Dependencies.** Declared dependencies are `@elizaos/core`, `@elizaos/plugin-registry`, and `@elizaos/shared`. The source also imports from `@elizaos/agent` subpaths (config, services, registry client) at runtime — `@elizaos/agent` is not listed in `package.json` but is provided by the host at runtime. Keep that boundary in mind if reorganizing.

## Verification

Follow the repository-wide verification and evidence standard in the [root CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md). Run
the package's relevant build, typecheck, lint, and test commands, then exercise
the real integration boundary changed by the work. Inspect the produced domain
artifacts and failure behavior; do not substitute mocked success for the system
under test.
