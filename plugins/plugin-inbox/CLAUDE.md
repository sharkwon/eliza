# @elizaos/plugin-inbox

Unified cross-channel inbox triage with unresolved-item tracking, snooze, archive, and follow-up watcher for Eliza agents.

## Purpose / role

Adds the inbox-zero workflow to an agent: a single `INBOX` umbrella action (op-based dispatch), `INBOX_TRIAGE` + `CROSS_CHANNEL_CONTEXT` providers that surface unresolved threads to the planner each turn, and a registered `/inbox` view for human review. Aggregates threads across email, Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, Slack, X, Farcaster, iMessage, and similar non-SMS channels. Android SMS stays in `@elizaos/plugin-messages`.

This package owns the triage domain carved out of `plugin-personal-assistant`: the persisted queue, queue operations, providers, schema, migration, and terminal/app view registration. It also owns the cross-channel **aggregation domain** (`src/inbox/aggregate.ts`: channel normalization, `buildInbox` thread grouping, `resolveInboxRequest`, LLM priority orchestration, and the cached read-through `InboxDomain`) plus the LLM priority scorer (`src/inbox/priority-scoring.ts`). `@elizaos/plugin-personal-assistant` keeps the transport route (`GET /api/lifeops/inbox`), the `life_inbox_messages` cache tables in `app_lifeops`, and the Gmail/X connector projections — it composes the `InboxDomain` by injecting those through the typed seams (`InboxMessageCache`, `PriorityScoringSettingsLoader`, `GmailInboxSource`/`XDmInboxSource`) and keeps behavior-identical re-export shims at the old import paths.

## Plugin surface

### Action

- `INBOX` (`src/actions/inbox.ts`) — single umbrella action with op-based dispatch. Accepted ops: `list`, `search`, `summarize`, `triage`, `reply`, `snooze`, `archive`, `approve`. `list`/`search`/`summarize` fan out through per-platform fetchers; `triage` reads the persisted unresolved queue; `reply` drafts/sends via MESSAGE triage adapters; `snooze` hides entries until an ISO timestamp; `archive` runs connector archive and resolves on success; `approve` sends the stored draft or suggested response.

### Providers

- `INBOX_TRIAGE` (`src/providers/inbox-triage.ts`) — position `14`. Emits the owner's pending urgent/needs-reply queue and recent auto-replies from `InboxRepository`.
- `CROSS_CHANNEL_CONTEXT` (`src/providers/cross-channel-context.ts`) — position `-3`. Emits recent unresolved activity for the current counterparty across other channels.

### Routes

- `GET /api/lifeops/inbox/triage` — list unresolved triage entries, optionally filtered by `classification`, `limit`, and `includeSnoozed`.
- `POST /api/lifeops/inbox/triage` — classify/persist inbound messages through `InboxService.triage`.
- `POST /api/lifeops/inbox/:id/reply` — draft or send a connector-backed reply.
- `POST /api/lifeops/inbox/:id/snooze` — set `snoozed_until`.
- `POST /api/lifeops/inbox/:id/archive` — archive through the connector adapter and resolve on success.
- `POST /api/lifeops/inbox/:id/approve` — send the stored draft/suggested response.

### Schema

- `inboxSchema` (`src/db/schema.ts`) — `pgSchema("app_inbox")` with the three
  inbox-triage tables carved out of PA's `app_lifeops`:
  - `life_inbox_triage_entries` — per-thread triage decisions + draft replies.
  - `life_inbox_triage_examples` — owner-labeled few-shot classification examples.
  - `life_email_unsubscribes` — email unsubscribe attempts + outcomes.
  Registered via the plugin `schema` field; `InboxMigrationService`
  (`src/inbox/migration.ts`) does the non-destructive `app_lifeops -> app_inbox`
  copy (skip if source missing / target non-empty, never drop the source) and
  repairs older `app_inbox.life_inbox_triage_entries` tables by adding
  `snoozed_until` if missing. PA
  auto-registers this plugin (`ensureLifeOpsInboxPluginRegistered`) so the schema
  exists + the migration runs whenever PA is loaded. The gmail sync/projection
  tables (`life_gmail_*`, `life_inbox_messages`) are NOT part of this domain —
  they stay PA-owned in `app_lifeops`.

### View

- `inbox` — `InboxView` component, path `/inbox`, bundle at `dist/views/bundle.js`. Shows the cross-channel inbox surface using the shared app client.

## Config / env vars

None. Channel credentials are read from each provider plugin (`plugin-discord`, `plugin-telegram`, etc.).

## How to extend

**Add a new op:** add the name to `SUBACTIONS` in `src/actions/inbox.ts`, add a case to the handler or `executeInboxQueueOperation`, and extend the action `parameters` array when the op needs new inputs. Queue ops should go through `InboxRepository` and, for connector dispatch, the shared MESSAGE triage service.

**Add a provider:** create `src/providers/<name>.ts` exporting a `Provider`, then add it to the `providers` array in `src/plugin.ts`.

**Add a domain operation:** extend `src/inbox/service.ts` and its repository or
connector seams. Add a long-lived runtime service to `src/plugin.ts` only when
the operation truly needs lifecycle ownership; export public contracts from
`src/index.ts`.

## Conventions / gotchas

- **`@elizaos/plugin-sql` must be loaded first.** The schema registration relies on the runtime's `runtime.db`. The plugin declares this in `dependencies: ["@elizaos/plugin-sql"]`.
- **No Android SMS.** SMS routing intentionally stays in `plugin-messages`. Do not add SMS channel handling here.
- **Schema name is `app_inbox`** (not `inbox`) to avoid collisions with any host-app `inbox` table the runtime might also surface.
- **Snooze is additive.** `snoozed_until` is append-only schema growth on `life_inbox_triage_entries`; migration repairs old targets and maps old `app_lifeops` rows with `NULL AS snoozed_until`.
- **Two build steps.** The JS/types build (tsup + tsc) and the Vite views build are separate. The views bundle (`dist/views/bundle.js`) is what the view registration's `bundlePath` points to. Both must be run for a complete build.
- **Peer deps.** React 19 and react-dom 19 are peer dependencies. The host app must provide them.
- See the root `CLAUDE.md` for repo-wide architecture rules, logger requirements,
  ESM/module standards, and the `packages/app` visual-review gate when this
  plugin changes UI rendered by the app.

## Verification

Follow the repository-wide verification and evidence standard in the [root CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md). Run
the package's relevant build, typecheck, lint, and test commands, then exercise
the real integration boundary changed by the work. Inspect the produced domain
artifacts and failure behavior; do not substitute mocked success for the system
under test.
