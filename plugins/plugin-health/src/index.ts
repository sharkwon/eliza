/**
 * @elizaos/plugin-health — Wave-1 (W1-B) extraction.
 *
 * Owns the sleep / circadian / health-metric / screen-time domain previously
 * intermingled with `app-lifeops`. LifeOps consumes plugin-health through:
 *
 *   - `ConnectorRegistry` contributions (apple_health, google_fit, strava,
 *     fitbit, withings, oura)
 *   - `ActivitySignalBus` publications (`health.sleep.detected`,
 *     `health.wake.observed`, `health.wake.confirmed`,
 *     `health.bedtime.imminent`, `health.regularity.changed`,
 *     `health.workout.completed`, …)
 *   - `AnchorRegistry` contributions (`wake.observed`, `wake.confirmed`,
 *     `bedtime.target`, `nap.start`)
 *   - Default-pack `ScheduledTask` records (bedtime / wake-up / sleep-recap)
 *
 * See `eliza/plugins/plugin-personal-assistant/docs/audit/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` §3.2 and
 * `wave1-interfaces.md` §5 for the canonical scope.
