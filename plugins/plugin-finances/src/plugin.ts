/**
 * elizaOS runtime plugin for the Finances overlay app.
 *
 * Registers the `/finances` view (the owner finance dashboard), the
 * `app_finances` drizzle schema, and the `FinancesMigrationService`. The
 * OWNER_FINANCES umbrella action and the `/api/lifeops/money/*` routes are
 * registered by `@elizaos/plugin-personal-assistant`, which delegates the
 * payments back-end (FinancesService / FinancesRepository) here.
 *
 * The drizzle schema (`pgSchema("app_finances")`) is registered via the Plugin
 * `schema` field so the elizaOS runtime handles migrations; loading this plugin
 * requires @elizaos/plugin-sql (declared as a peer dep and in `dependencies`).
