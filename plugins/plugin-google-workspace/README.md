# @elizaos/plugin-google-workspace

Google Workspace integration for [elizaOS](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza) agents — Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, and Google Meet under a single per-account OAuth grant, plus a Google Chat messaging connector (service-account auth).

## What it does

This plugin adds `GoogleWorkspaceService` to an Eliza agent runtime. The service exposes typed methods for reading and writing to Gmail, Calendar, Drive (including Docs and Sheets), and Meet. Authentication is account-scoped: every method call includes an `accountId` that maps to a stored OAuth token, so one agent can operate across multiple Google accounts simultaneously.

The plugin also registers with the elizaOS `ConnectorAccountManager` so the built-in connector HTTP routes can manage Google accounts (list, create, delete) and run the OAuth flow (PKCE, offline access, incremental consent) without extra integration work.

The plugin also ships the Google Chat connector (`src/chat/`): `GoogleChatService` registers a runtime `MessageConnector` for sending/receiving messages in Chat spaces, DMs, and threads, and `GoogleChatWorkflowCredentialProvider` supplies `googleChatOAuth2Api` credentials to the workflow plugin. Chat authenticates with a **service account** (`GOOGLE_CHAT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT[_FILE]` or `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.bot`) — a deliberately separate auth model from the Workspace OAuth grant. The plugin auto-enables when a `connectors.googlechat` block is configured (see `auto-enable.ts`); the Workspace side remains opt-in.

## Capabilities

### Gmail

- Search messages by query string
- Fetch message metadata and full body
- Triage inbox (unread, importance score, reply-needed detection)
- List unresponded threads
- Send new messages and replies
- Bulk modify labels/state (archive, trash, mark read/unread, apply/remove labels)
- Create sender filters
- Send mailto unsubscribe emails

### Google Calendar

- List calendars
- List, get, create, update, and delete events
- Create events with Google Meet links attached

### Google Drive, Docs, and Sheets

- Search and list files and folders
- Get file metadata
- Read Google Docs as plain text
- Read Google Sheets as a 2D array of rows
- Create Drive files (with optional content and parent folder)
- Append text to a Google Doc
- Write cell values to a Sheet range

### Google Meet

- Create meeting spaces
- Get space details and active conference records
- List participants, participant sessions, transcripts, and recordings
- Fetch full transcript entries
- End an active conference
- Generate a structured meeting report (summary, key points, action items, full transcript)
- Build a canonical `elizaos.meeting_artifact.v1` artifact from Google Meet API
  responses, Google Docs transcript text, recordings, and bot-free capture
  artifacts. The canonical artifact preserves streams, participants, participant
  sessions, transcript spans, generated notes, mismatch warnings, missing
  artifact classifications, and import metrics.

## Requirements

- Node.js (this plugin uses Node-only APIs; not supported in browser or edge environments)
- A Google Cloud project with the OAuth 2.0 credentials and relevant APIs enabled

### Google Cloud APIs to enable

- Gmail API
- Google Calendar API
- Google Drive API
- Google Meet API (REST)
- Google Docs API
- Google Sheets API

## Configuration

Set these environment variables (or provide them via agent `pluginParameters`):

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | No (required for OAuth) | OAuth 2.0 client ID from Google Cloud Console |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | No (required for OAuth) | OAuth 2.0 client secret (keep private) |
| `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` | No (required for OAuth) | Redirect URI registered in Google Cloud Console |

Without all three the OAuth flow throws an error; the service itself still starts (read-only agents that inject pre-issued tokens can skip OAuth).

## Enabling the plugin

Add the plugin to your elizaOS agent configuration:

```ts
import { googlePlugin } from "@elizaos/plugin-google-workspace";

const agent = {
  plugins: [googlePlugin],
  // ...
};
```

## OAuth scopes

Scopes are derived from the set of capabilities requested at OAuth time, not from a hardcoded list. Requesting only `gmail.read` will ask for `gmail.readonly` only, not all Google Workspace scopes. All grants request `openid`, `userinfo.email`, and `userinfo.profile` as identity scopes.

Available capabilities: `gmail.read`, `gmail.send`, `gmail.manage`, `calendar.read`, `calendar.write`, `drive.read`, `drive.write`, `meet.create`, `meet.read`.

## Using the service

```ts
import type { IGoogleWorkspaceService } from "@elizaos/plugin-google-workspace";

const google = runtime.getService("google") as IGoogleWorkspaceService;

// List upcoming calendar events
const events = await google.listEvents({
  accountId: "my-google-account-id",
  timeMin: new Date().toISOString(),
  limit: 10,
});

// Send an email
const result = await google.sendGmailMessage({
  accountId: "my-google-account-id",
  to: ["recipient@example.com"],
  subject: "Hello",
  bodyText: "Message body.",
});
```

## Custom credential resolver

For testing or non-standard hosting, inject a `GoogleCredentialResolver`:

```ts
import { GoogleWorkspaceService } from "@elizaos/plugin-google-workspace";

const service = new GoogleWorkspaceService(runtime, {
  credentialResolver: myCustomResolver,
});
```
