/**
 * Built-in generic fallback default-task pack.
 *
 * `@elizaos/plugin-scheduling` ships ZERO domain content — the rich first-run
 * pack (gm / gn / daily check-in / morning-brief watcher + a paused weekly
 * review) belongs to `@elizaos/plugin-personal-assistant`, the consumer. But PA
 * is not loaded on a stock mobile boot (it pulls `@elizaos/app-core`,
 * `@elizaos/agent`, `@elizaos/plugin-google-workspace`, and `@capacitor/core`), so on a
 * phone the scheduling spine + routes load with NO pack registered and the home
 * "Tasks" widget would have nothing to show.
 *
 * This module supplies a SMALL, generic fallback the spine seeds ONLY when no
 * consumer pack has registered (see `fallback: true` + the seeder's gate). When
 * PA is present its richer pack registers a non-fallback pack and this one is
 * skipped, so the two never double-seed. The wording is deliberately generic
 * (no PA-domain coupling) and the source is tagged `default_pack`.
 *
 * Pack contents (both `respectsGlobalPause: true`, `ownerVisible: true`):
 *   - **Good morning** — a `reminder` on a daily cron (08:00 local, UTC), so it
 *     ships RUNNING and the widget shows it on the running top-line.
 *   - **Weekly review** — a `recap` with a `manual` trigger, so it exists and
 *     is owner-visible but never fires on its own → ships PAUSED. A starter the
 *     owner can give a schedule or run on demand.
 *
 * The UI adapter (`packages/ui/src/utils/scheduled-task-to-automation.ts`) maps
 * `metadata.recordKey` → title and `trigger.kind === "manual"` → the paused
 * status, so these two records render as "Good morning" (active) and "Weekly
 * review" (paused) with no extra UI wiring.
