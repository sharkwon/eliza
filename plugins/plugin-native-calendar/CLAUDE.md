# @elizaos/capacitor-calendar

A Capacitor plugin that reads and writes Apple Calendar events through EventKit, for use in elizaOS iOS apps and macOS desktop runtimes.

## Purpose / Role

This package exposes a `AppleCalendar` Capacitor plugin object that Eliza agents embedded in an iOS or macOS Electrobun application can call to interact with the device's native calendar store via EventKit. On web/browser targets every method returns a graceful `not_supported` result — no calendar access is possible outside the native runtime. The package is **not** an elizaOS `Plugin` object (no actions/providers/services); it is a Capacitor native-bridge library imported by whichever elizaOS plugin or service layer needs calendar access.

## Plugin Surface

This is a **Capacitor bridge library**, not an elizaOS runtime plugin. It registers one Capacitor plugin object:

| Export | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `AppleCalendar` | Capacitor plugin instance. Call its methods to access EventKit. |
| `appleCalendarMacosBridgeCandidates` | Shared macOS EventKit dylib candidate policy consumed by LifeOps and other host plugins. |
| `APPLE_CALENDAR_MACOS_BRIDGE_DYLIB_BASENAME` | Expected macOS EventKit dylib basename. |

### `AppleCalendar` methods (all return Promises)

| Method | Input | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `checkPermissions()` | — | Returns current EventKit authorization state (`granted`, `write_only`, `denied`, `prompt`, or `restricted`). |
| `requestPermissions(options?)` | `{ access?: "full_access" \| "write_only" }` | Prompts for the requested access level. Full access is the compatibility default; older iOS uses the legacy full-access API. |
| `listCalendars()` | — | Returns all calendars visible in EventKit. |
| `listEvents(options)` | `{ calendarId?, timeMin, timeMax }` | Fetches events within the ISO 8601 time window. Pass `calendarId = "all"` or omit for every calendar. |
| `createEvent(input)` | `AppleCalendarEventInput` | Creates and saves a new event. Attendees are not supported by EventKit for third-party apps. |
| `updateEvent(input)` | `AppleCalendarUpdateEventInput` | Patches fields on an existing event by `eventId`. |
| `deleteEvent(input)` | `{ eventId }` | Removes an event by EventKit identifier. |

### Exported types (from `src/definitions.ts`)

`AppleCalendarPlugin`, `AppleCalendarPermissionStatus`, `AppleCalendarPermissionState`, `AppleCalendarRequestedAccess`, `AppleCalendarPermissionRequest`, `AppleCalendarSummary`, `AppleCalendarEvent`, `AppleCalendarAttendee`, `AppleCalendarEventInput`, `AppleCalendarUpdateEventInput`, `AppleCalendarDeleteEventInput`, `AppleCalendarListEventsOptions`, `AppleCalendarListResult`, `AppleCalendarEventsResult`, `AppleCalendarEventResult`, `AppleCalendarCreateReceipt`, `AppleCalendarCreateResult`, `AppleCalendarBaseResult`.

    macos-bridge-policy.ts  Shared macOS EventKit dylib candidate policy.
    web.ts            Browser/web fallback. checkPermissions/requestPermissions return { calendar: "restricted", canRequest: false }; all other methods return { ok: false, error: "not_supported" }.

```

## Commands

Scripts are defined in `package.json`; run them from the repo root with `bun run --cwd`:

```bash
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-calendar clean           # remove build output
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-calendar build           # build package artifacts
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-calendar typecheck       # TypeScript typecheck
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-calendar lint            # mutating Biome check
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-calendar lint:check      # read-only Biome check
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-calendar format          # write formatting
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-calendar format:check    # read-only formatting check
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-calendar test            # run package tests
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-calendar prepublishOnly  # publish-time build hook
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-calendar build:unlocked  # bun run clean && tsc && bunx rollup -c rollup.config.mjs
```

## Config / Env Vars

None. This package reads no environment variables and has no runtime configuration. All behavior is governed by iOS/macOS system permissions granted by the user.

## How to Extend

### Add a new method to the Capacitor bridge

1. Define the method signature in `src/definitions.ts` on `AppleCalendarPlugin` and add any input/output interfaces.
2. Add a web fallback returning `{ ...unsupported }` in `src/web.ts` so browser targets keep compiling.
3. Add the native implementation in `ios/Sources/CalendarPlugin/CalendarPlugin.swift`:
   - Register it in `pluginMethods` with `CAPPluginMethod(name: "myMethod", returnType: CAPPluginReturnPromise)`.
   - Implement `@objc func myMethod(_ call: CAPPluginCall)`.
4. Re-export any new types from `src/index.ts` if they need to be public (re-exported automatically via `export * from "./definitions"`).
5. Build: `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-calendar build`.

## Conventions / Gotchas

- **Not an elizaOS Plugin object.** There is no `Plugin` export with actions/providers/services. This is a Capacitor bridge; import `AppleCalendar` and call it directly from service code.
- **Attendees are blocked by EventKit.** `createEvent`/`updateEvent` reject any `attendees` payload with `error: "unsupported_feature"`. EventKit does not permit third-party apps to set invitees.
- **macOS uses the Electrobun EventKit dylib**, not this Capacitor plugin, for the desktop runtime. This Capacitor path is for the iOS/Capacitor app shell only.
- **macOS bridge policy lives here.** Host plugins may resolve and call the Electrobun EventKit dylib, but the candidate list and expected basename belong to this package.
- **iOS 17+ permission model.** Full access and write-only are distinct states. `requestPermissions()` defaults to `requestFullAccessToEvents`; callers may request add-only access explicitly. Older devices fall back to legacy `requestAccess(to:)`, whose approved state is full access.
- **Write-only is a narrow creation capability.** It can save a new event only to `defaultCalendarForNewEvents`. It cannot list calendars, list/read events, update, or delete, including an event created by this app.
- **Write-only success is a receipt, not readback.** The result has `readBackAvailable: false` and `eventId: null`; only full access returns the serialized EventKit event.
- **Creation fields are required.** TypeScript and Swift both require a non-empty title plus valid `startAt` and `endAt` values. EventKit supplies no defaults for direct saves.
- **Dates must be ISO 8601.** The Swift layer accepts both fractional-seconds and whole-seconds variants; always pass UTC ISO strings from TypeScript.
- **`calendarId = "primary"` or `""` resolves to `defaultCalendarForNewEvents`** in the Swift layer.
- **Build output:** `dist/plugin.cjs.js` (CJS), `dist/esm/index.js` (ESM), `dist/plugin.js` (IIFE for unpkg). The `bun`/`development` export condition resolves directly to `src/index.ts` for source-mode development.
- See the root `CLAUDE.md` for repo-wide architecture rules, naming conventions, and logger requirements.

## Verification

Follow the repository-wide verification and evidence standard in the [root CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md). Run
the package's relevant build, typecheck, lint, and test commands, then exercise
the real integration boundary changed by the work. Inspect the produced domain
artifacts and failure behavior; do not substitute mocked success for the system
under test.
