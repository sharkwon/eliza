/**
 * Live-LLM evidence scenario (#11856): a REAL model must route a natural "join
 * this meeting and take notes" request (with a Google Meet URL) to the real
 * JOIN_MEETING handler. MeetingService then attempts a genuine browser join; on
 * a headless/keyless-Chrome host the join fails at the browser/admission step,
 * which is fine — the trajectory proves planner → JOIN_MEETING → MeetingService
 * with the real error surfaced.
