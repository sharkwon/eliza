/**
 * Tone preference enforcement — the user previously declared "be terse, no
 * pleasantries". Subsequent drafts must respect that.
 *
 * Seed: a meeting prefs row that says terse=true and an inbox triage entry
 * to reply to. The user asks for a draft. The draft must be short and not
 * start with pleasantries ("Hi there, hope you're well!").
 *
 * Failure modes guarded:
 *   - long flowery openings
 *   - "hope you're doing well" / "hope this finds you" boilerplate
 *   - 5+ sentence drafts for a simple confirm
 *
 * Cited: 03-coverage-gap-matrix.md — tone-preference enforcement.
