/**
 * Inbox triage on a 500-unread inbox — agent must summarize / batch, NOT
 * enumerate every row, and NOT fabricate counts that disagree with the
 * seeded data.
 *
 * Failure modes guarded:
 *   - dumping all 500 entries verbatim (token explosion)
 *   - producing a reply with a row count that contradicts the seed
 *   - silently truncating without telling the user
 *
 * The seed inserts 500 synthetic triage rows of mixed urgency. The agent
 * must (a) acknowledge the volume, (b) batch / summarize, and (c) NOT call
 * 500 individual INBOX_TRIAGE actions.
 *
 * Cited: 03-coverage-gap-matrix.md — "large inbox / batched summary" has
 * no scenario today.
