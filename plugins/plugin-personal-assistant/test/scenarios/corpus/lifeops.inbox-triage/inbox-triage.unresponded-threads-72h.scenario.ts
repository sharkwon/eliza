/**
 * Surface stale threads — emails the user sent that have NOT been replied
 * to in >72h must be surfaced as "still waiting on a reply".
 *
 * Seed: 3 sent-but-unanswered triage rows of varying age (24h, 72h, 7d),
 * plus 1 row that has been replied to.
 *
 * Failure modes guarded:
 *   - treating sent messages as nothing to do
 *   - surfacing the 24h-old thread (too fresh)
 *   - missing the 7-day-old thread (stalest, highest signal)
 *
 * Cited: 03-coverage-gap-matrix.md — stale-thread surfacing.
