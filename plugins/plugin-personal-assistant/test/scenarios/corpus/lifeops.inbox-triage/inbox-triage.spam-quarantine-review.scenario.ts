/**
 * Spam quarantine review — the user asks the agent to surface anything in
 * the spam queue that might be a false positive. Agent must distinguish
 * actual spam from likely-legit-but-mis-classified mail.
 *
 * Seed: 3 spam rows — two obvious spam (Nigerian prince, crypto pump), one
 * likely false-positive (a calendar invite from a known domain).
 *
 * Failure modes guarded:
 *   - treating all spam as legitimate ("here are 3 messages to handle!")
 *   - missing the false-positive entirely
 *   - bulk-deleting without flagging the false-positive
 *
 * Cited: 03-coverage-gap-matrix.md — spam queue review.
