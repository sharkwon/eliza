/**
 * Inbox triage on a 3-message thread, draft must wait for sign-off.
 *
 * Failure modes guarded:
 *   - sending the draft before the user approves
 *   - drafting from only the first message (ignoring the thread)
 *   - completing the action with no approval-queue entry recorded
 *
 * Existing scenarios (gmail.draft.reply-from-context.scenario.ts) test
 * single-message draft creation. This scenario adds the contract that
 * (a) the draft considers all 3 thread messages, (b) an approval queue
 * entry is created, and (c) no `messages.send` runs until approval.
 *
 * Cited: 03-coverage-gap-matrix.md row 26 — inbox triage with thread +
 * draft sign-off has no scenario.
