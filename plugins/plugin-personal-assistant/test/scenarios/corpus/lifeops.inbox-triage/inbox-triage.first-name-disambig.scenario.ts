/**
 * First-name disambiguation — when the user says "reply to Jill" and TWO
 * triage entries are from people named Jill, the agent must clarify which
 * Jill, NOT silently pick one.
 *
 * Seed: Jill Anderson (vendor pricing) and Jill Park (coffee plans). User
 * prompt: "reply to Jill saying yes that works".
 *
 * Failure modes guarded:
 *   - silently sending to the wrong Jill
 *   - drafting to both Jills
 *   - drafting to neither and saying "done"
