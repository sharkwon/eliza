/**
 * Triage entry with an attachment. The user asks the agent to draft a reply
 * acknowledging the attached file. The draft must reference the file by
 * name and not pretend the attachment was opened/parsed (the agent can't).
 *
 * Failure modes guarded:
 *   - silently dropping the attachment from context
 *   - hallucinating attachment content the agent never had access to
 *   - producing a draft with no attachment reference
 *
 * Cited: 03-coverage-gap-matrix.md — "attachment in thread, draft must
