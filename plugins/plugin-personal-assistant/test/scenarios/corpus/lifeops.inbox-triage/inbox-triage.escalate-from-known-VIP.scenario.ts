/**
 * Entity-aware priority bump — a message from a known VIP must escalate
 * regardless of its raw urgency score.
 *
 * Seed: a "low" urgency triage row from a VIP-flagged sender (board chair),
 * alongside a "high" urgency row from a random pager. The agent must
 * surface the VIP row at or near the top, NOT discount it as "low".
 *
 * Failure modes guarded:
 *   - ranking purely by the seeded urgency column
 *   - ignoring VIP / relationship signal
