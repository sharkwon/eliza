/**
 * Gmail connector returns 5xx mid-triage — agent must degrade gracefully,
 * NOT crash and NOT claim a clean inbox.
 *
 * The agent is asked to triage Gmail while the connector returns 500. The
 * scenario verifies the agent (a) surfaces the failure as a failure and
 * (b) does NOT claim "0 unread" or fabricate a clean summary.
 *
 * Failure modes guarded:
 *   - silent fallback to empty inbox on connector error
 *   - hard crash or unhandled promise rejection (no reply at all)
 *   - claiming success when fetch failed
 *
