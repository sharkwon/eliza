/**
 * Bulk archive with undo window — after the agent processes a bulk archive,
 * the user immediately says "wait, undo that". The agent must roll back
 * (or refuse to confirm-send) within 60s.
 *
 * Two-turn: first turn does bulk archive via approval, second turn requests
 * undo. The agent must produce a clear acknowledgement that the operation
 * is reversed, or that an undo is queued.
 *
 * Failure modes guarded:
 *   - agent says "I can't undo" without trying
 *   - agent fabricates a successful undo with no actual side effect
 *   - agent re-archives instead of un-archiving
 *
