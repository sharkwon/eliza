/**
 * Apple Reminders permission denied → fall back to internal reminder OR
 * surface the permission ask.
 *
 * Failure modes guarded:
 *   - silently failing to create any reminder (the user's request is dropped)
 *   - claiming the native Apple reminder was created when it wasn't
 *   - throwing an error to the user without offering a path forward
 *
 * The scenario writes a settings row that signals "apple reminders is not
 * permitted" and asks the agent to set a reminder. The valid outcomes are:
 *   (a) the agent creates an internal life_task_definitions row (LIFE
 *       action), OR
 *   (b) the agent's reply asks the user to grant permission AND no broken
 *       state is recorded.
 *
 * Cited: 03-coverage-gap-matrix.md row 15 — apple reminders permission
 * denied has no scenario.
