/**
 * DST boundary on a recurring event series — modify-this-instance must not
 * silently retime sibling instances on the other side of the boundary.
 *
 * Seeds a daily 8am Pacific standup recurring across the 2025 fall-back day.
 * The pre-DST instances should land at 15:00Z, post-DST at 16:00Z. The user
 * asks the agent to "move tomorrow's standup to 9am" — only the named
 * instance should move; the rest of the series must stay anchored at 8am
 * local on their respective dates.
 *
 * Cited: docs/audits/lifeops-2026-05-09/03-coverage-gap-matrix.md — recurring
 * series + DST has no scenario coverage today.
