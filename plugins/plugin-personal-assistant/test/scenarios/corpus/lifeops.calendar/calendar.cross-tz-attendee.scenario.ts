/**
 * Cross-timezone attendee proposal — Denver organizer with a Tokyo attendee.
 *
 * Failure mode guarded: the agent proposes times in the organizer's TZ only
 * and assumes the attendee will translate. With a 17h difference between
 * Denver (UTC-7 MDT) and Tokyo (UTC+9 JST), a "3pm-5pm slot" for Denver
 * lands at 6am-8am next-day Tokyo — almost certainly outside Tokyo waking
 * hours. The agent must explicitly respect BOTH TZ ranges.
