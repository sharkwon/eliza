/**
 * Morning brief on an empty inbox.
 *
 * Failure mode this guards against: when the user has zero unread messages,
 * triage entries, and pending drafts, the brief generator must say so —
 * NOT fabricate fake messages, NOT crash, NOT echo a stale fixture. The
 * SOFT existing morning-brief tests pre-seed answers and substring-match
 * (see audits/lifeops-2026-05-09/02-scenario-larp-audit.md), so this is the
 * negative-path counterpart that they all skip.
 *
 * Seed: explicitly clear inbox triage, approval queue, and life_task_occurrences
 * to emulate "empty inbox / nothing to do".
 *
 * Assertion: the agent must (a) call CHECKIN, (b) the response must NOT
 * contain any specific person/subject line, AND (c) the judge must rule the
 * reply is a degenerate/empty-state reply.
 *
 * Cited: 02-scenario-larp-audit.md §lifeops-morning-brief-fixtures (LARP
 * pre-bakes investor / clinic strings); 03-coverage-gap-matrix.md row 24
 * "morning brief covers empty inbox" — currently no scenario.
