/**
 * Morning brief with an urgent message arriving mid-brief.
 *
 * The agent is asked for a morning brief. Two urgent triage entries are
 * pre-seeded (representing items that landed while the brief was being
 * generated). The brief must surface BOTH urgent items — either by listing
 * them explicitly, or by acknowledging that priority items came in and
 * escalating one of them.
 *
 * Failure modes guarded:
 *   - silently dropping items that arrived during the request window
 *   - returning a stale/cached brief that excludes them
 *   - returning a brief without acknowledging the urgent flag
 *
 * Cited: 03-coverage-gap-matrix.md row 24 / row 26 — no scenario exercises
 * the "fresh urgent inbound during brief generation" path.
 *
 * Note on race: the scenario-runner is single-threaded against the
 * scenario's own clock; we can't truly inject during generation. We seed
 * "fresh" by setting created_at = now and urgency = high, and assert the
 * brief reflects what's in the live triage table at the moment of the
 * action invocation. That covers the same logical contract: the brief
 * reads from the live table, not a snapshot.
