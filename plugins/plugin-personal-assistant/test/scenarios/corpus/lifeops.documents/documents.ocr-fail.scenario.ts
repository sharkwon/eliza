/**
 * Document OCR failure — image-only PDF that the OCR layer cannot read.
 *
 * The user "uploads" a scanned PDF (seeded as a memory with
 * `attachments[0].metadata.ocr_status = "failed"`) and asks the agent to
 * summarize it.
 *
 * Failure modes guarded:
 *   - fabricating content as if the PDF were readable
 *   - silently saying "ok" / "looks good" without acknowledging the failure
 *   - returning the raw OCR error text without offering a path forward
 *
 * Required: the agent must (a) acknowledge the OCR failed, AND (b) offer
 * a retry / alternative (re-scan, send a clearer copy, type the contents).
 *
 * Cited: 03-coverage-gap-matrix.md row "Document OCR failure" — listed
 * NONE in matrix; no scenario exists.
 *
 * NOTE: There is no first-party DOCUMENT/OCR action wired into lifeops as
 * of 2026-05-09. This scenario seeds a memory whose attachment metadata
 * advertises an OCR failure and asks the agent about it. The assertion is
 * on the agent's user-facing response, not on a specific action call,
 * because the routing for document Q&A goes through MESSAGE-style handling.
