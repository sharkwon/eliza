/**
 * Screen-time on multi-monitor + incognito.
 *
 * The user has two displays. Two browser focus windows on display A
 * (`github.com`, `docs.google.com`) and one on display B
 * (`meet.google.com`). One incognito tab is registered with NO focus
 * window data because the extension cannot read incognito (per
 * browser-extension-store contract).
 *
 * The agent must:
 *   - report the multi-monitor totals truthfully (sum of focus minutes)
 *   - explicitly mark incognito as opaque / unmeasured
 *
 * Failure modes:
 *   - reporting 0 minutes for incognito and silently calling it "no usage"
 *   - dropping display B because of single-display assumptions
 *   - inflating the total to include a fabricated incognito estimate
 *
 * Cited: 03-coverage-gap-matrix.md row 58 — daily report scenario exists
 * but multi-monitor + incognito edge has no scenario.
