/**
 * Hygiene: brush teeth twice daily — canonical happy path.
 *
 * Adapted from the runtime fixture `plugins/plugin-personal-assistant/scenarios/brush-teeth-basic.json`
 * into the executable `.scenario.ts` form used by the workspace runner. The
 * existing runtime fixture stays in place to drive bench dispatch; this file
 * is the executable test-time form that lives under the workspace scenario
 * tree and is discovered by the scenario runner CLI.
 *
 * Assertion: the agent calls LIFE with create_definition for "Brush teeth"
 * at twice-per-day cadence (8am, 9pm), with a reminder plan attached.
