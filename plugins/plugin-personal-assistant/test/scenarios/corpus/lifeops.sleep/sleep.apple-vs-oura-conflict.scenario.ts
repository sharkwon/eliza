/**
 * Sleep multi-source conflict — Apple Health says 7h, Oura says 8h.
 *
 * Failure modes guarded:
 *   - silently averaging the two sources without flagging the conflict
 *   - silently picking one provider with no provenance attached
 *   - returning a single number that doesn't surface either source
 *
 * Required behavior: the agent's reply must (a) acknowledge BOTH sources
 * exist, (b) report the synthesized record, AND (c) attach provenance —
 * either by naming the chosen source or by reporting both numbers.
 *
 * This scenario does not enforce a single resolution rule (highest-confidence,
 * latest-write, etc.); the existing `parseHealthSleepEpisodes` in
 * `plugin-health/src/sleep/sleep-cycle.ts:201` doesn't yet pick between two
 * provider rows for the same night. What we DO assert is the behavior the
 * user can observe: the agent surfaces the conflict honestly.
 *
 * Cited: 03-coverage-gap-matrix.md row 13 / sleep events; sleep-multi-source
 * conflict has zero scenarios. plugin-health/src/sleep/sleep-cycle.ts:285-287
 * dedupes by source+timestamp but doesn't disambiguate competing providers.
