/**
 * Signal permission denied — Signal connector is degraded / not authorized.
 * Agent must continue with available channels and report Signal as
 * unavailable rather than silently dropping it.
 *
 * Failure modes guarded:
 *   - silently omitting Signal from cross-channel summaries
 *   - hard-failing the whole multi-channel query because one channel is down
 *
