/**
 * Unanswered-decision bump — user-sent question across multiple channels
 * with no reply. Agent must surface it and propose a bump (resend, escalate
 * to next channel, or follow-up reminder).
 *
 * Failure modes guarded:
 *   - dropping the unanswered question silently
 *   - bumping the wrong person/channel
