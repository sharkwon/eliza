/**
 * Identity rename survives — when a contact changes display name (e.g.
 * marriage), the canonical identity persists. The agent must NOT split
 * pre-rename and post-rename messages into two people.
 *
 * Failure modes guarded:
 *   - treating "Priya Rao" and "Priya Smith" as different people
 *   - losing all pre-rename history on rename
 *
 * Cited: 03-coverage-gap-matrix.md — rename survival.
