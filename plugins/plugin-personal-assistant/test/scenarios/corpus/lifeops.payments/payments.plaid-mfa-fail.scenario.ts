/**
 * Plaid bank-link MFA fail.
 *
 * Bug class this guards: when Plaid's `/link/token/exchange` returns an
 * `ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED` or MFA-failure response, the agent must (a) NOT
 * pretend the link succeeded, (b) NOT silently retry, (c) surface the
 * actionable error to the user with the next step (re-auth in the linked
 * accounts UI).
 *
 * The test seeds a fake Plaid connector grant in a "MFA failed" state and
 * asks the agent for the linked-accounts overview. The PAYMENTS action's
 * structured result must mark the bank source as `state: "needs_reauth"`
 * (or equivalent error state) AND the agent's reply must reference the
 * action the user should take.
 *
 * Cited: 03-coverage-gap-matrix.md row "bank link MFA fail" / NONE in matrix.
 *
 * BLOCKED-ON-MOCKOON: there is no `plaid.json` mockoon environment yet
 * (`packages/scenario-runner/test/mocks/environments/` has no plaid file as of 2026-05-09). The
 * scenario seeds the failure state directly into the lifeops payment_sources
 * table to exercise the agent's read+report path. When the Plaid mockoon
 * lands, the seed should be replaced with an actual mock-server roundtrip.
 *
 * Gated on `LIFEOPS_USE_MOCKOON=1` for the mockoon round-trip path; the
 * direct DB-seed path always runs.
