/**
 * Planner — top-retrieval candidate is wrong, planner must self-correct.
 *
 * The user says "block out 2 hours tomorrow morning for deep work". The
 * tokenized retrieval lookup will surface WEBSITE_BLOCK and APP_BLOCK
 * (because of "block") even though the right action is CALENDAR
 * (calendar event titled "Deep work block"). The planner must reject
 * the misleading candidates and pick the right action via reasoning,
 * OR ask a clarifying question.
 *
 * Failure modes guarded:
 *   - planner picks WEBSITE_BLOCK or APP_BLOCK because it's the top hit
 *   - planner blocks all distractor sites without first creating the
 *     calendar event
 *
 * Cited: 03-coverage-gap-matrix.md "Tool search returns wrong tool" —
 * listed NONE; no scenario covers this.
