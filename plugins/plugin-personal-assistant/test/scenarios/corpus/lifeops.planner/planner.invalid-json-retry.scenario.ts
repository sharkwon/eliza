/**
 * Planner — invalid JSON on first call, retry recovers.
 *
 * The planner expects a JSON array of action calls. When the model returns
 * non-JSON or malformed JSON, the planner-loop retries (planner-loop.ts:771-797).
 * The trajectory recorder tags subsequent stages with `retryIdx > 0`
 * (trajectory-recorder.ts:152). This scenario:
 *
 *   1. Sends a complex prompt with intentionally adversarial structure
 *      designed to elevate the chance of malformed first-pass output
 *      (multiple ambiguous intents requiring careful structured output).
 *   2. Inspects the trajectory directory written under
 *      `<runDir>/trajectories/<agentId>/...` and checks whether ANY
 *      planner stage was emitted with `retryIdx > 0`.
 *   3. Confirms that the agent ALSO produced a final action — i.e. the
 *      retry path completed.
 *
 * If the first attempt happens to succeed (which is the common case with a
 * strong model), the predicate degrades gracefully: it requires that the
 * planner ran at all, and reports a `retry-not-triggered` skip reason. This
 * scenario is genuinely useful when the recorder captures a retry — it's
 * the only e2e proof that the retry path works.
 *
 * Cited: 03-coverage-gap-matrix.md "Planner returns invalid JSON, retries"
 * — listed NONE; no scenario.
 *
 * Note: this scenario requires `ELIZA_LIFEOPS_RUN_DIR` to be set (i.e. it
 * must be run via `--run-dir`). When run without `--run-dir`, the recorder
 * writes to `~/.eliza/trajectories/` and the post-check still works as
 * long as the recorder is enabled (default).
