/**
 * Planner — tool search returns no candidate.
 *
 * The user asks for something that maps to no enabled action. The planner
 * must (a) NOT pick a wrong tool just to do something, (b) reply in
 * natural language, (c) NOT echo a fake structured "I'm doing X" response.
 *
 * Question chosen: a question with no operational intent — purely
 * conversational chitchat that maps to no LIFE/CALENDAR/MESSAGE/SCREEN_TIME
 * etc. action.
 *
 * Failure modes guarded:
 *   - planner picks the closest-matching action and runs it (e.g. CHECKIN
 *     on "how's it going?")
 *   - planner returns a fake action result with no real side effect
 *   - retrieval picks a wrong tool from semantic similarity
 *
 * Cited: 03-coverage-gap-matrix.md row "Tool search returns no candidate"
 * — listed NONE in matrix; 04-telemetry-audit.md notes the toolSearch
 * stage is the only missing recorder phase.
