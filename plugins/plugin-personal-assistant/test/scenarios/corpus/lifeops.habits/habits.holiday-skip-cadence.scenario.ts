/**
 * Habits: holiday calendar integration — when a federal holiday falls on a
 * recurring habit day, the agent should skip the occurrence rather than
 * marking it missed.
 *
 * The check-in surface should expose `habitSummaries` without a missed
 * streak for the holiday-skipped habit. We seed an existing habit
 * definition and rely on the runtime's holiday-aware cadence.
