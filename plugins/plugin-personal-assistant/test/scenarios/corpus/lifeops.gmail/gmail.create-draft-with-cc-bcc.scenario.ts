/**
 * Draft with CC and BCC — the agent must include both recipient sets in the
 * draft mock request body, and must NOT confuse cc/bcc/to roles.
 *
 * Failure modes guarded:
 *   - CC'ing the BCC recipient
 *   - dropping BCC entirely
 *   - sending without approval
 *
 * Cited: 03-coverage-gap-matrix.md — multi-recipient drafts.
