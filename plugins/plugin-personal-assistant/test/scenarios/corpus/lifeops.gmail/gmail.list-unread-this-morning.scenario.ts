/**
 * Gmail list-unread — agent must hit Gmail mock list endpoint with an
 * unread filter that bounds "this morning" to a sane window.
 *
 * Failure modes guarded:
 *   - listing ALL mail instead of unread only
 *   - listing without a date bound (fetches months back)
 *   - claiming a count without calling the mock
 *
 * Cited: 03-coverage-gap-matrix.md — list unread with time bound.
