/**
 * Two-turn send: draft → approve → send. The agent creates a draft, the
 * user explicitly says "send it", and only then does Gmail send fire.
 *
 * Failure modes guarded:
 *   - sending immediately without intermediate draft
 *   - failing to send after explicit approval
 *
 * Cited: 03-coverage-gap-matrix.md — send-after-approval round trip.
