/**
 * Attachment metadata — the agent must surface attachment filename/size from
 * the message metadata WITHOUT downloading the attachment bytes (no
 * `attachments/get` call required if the user only asked "what's attached").
 *
 * Failure modes guarded:
 *   - downloading attachments wholesale when metadata suffices
 *   - fabricating attachment names that aren't in the fixture
