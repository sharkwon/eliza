/**
 * Live-model email-reply-draft outcome for the LifeOps email capability: seeds a
 * real inbound email, asks the agent to DRAFT a reply, and asserts the result
 * against the loopback Gmail mock — a draft was actually created
 * (gmailDraftCreated/draftExists), its body carries the right recipient and the
 * requested Friday-afternoon availability (gmailActionArguments + mock request
 * body), and nothing was SENT (gmailMessageSent:false, gmailNoRealWrite). The
 * MESSAGE `draft_reply` subaction is the path under test.
