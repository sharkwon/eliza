/**
 * LifeOps Journey #14 — Flight Conflict Detection And Rebooking
 *
 * Calendar conflict detected → agent proposes alternative flights → rebook
 * executed after approval → calendar updated.
 *
 * PRD §Suite D — Travel And Event Operations
 * (`ea.travel.flight-conflict-rebooking`).
 *
 * Setup: a flight on Wed 8 AM and a calendar event Wed 9 AM that the agent
 * detects as overlapping with a layover.
 *
 * Gate: ELIZA_LIVE_TEST=1 + provider key.
