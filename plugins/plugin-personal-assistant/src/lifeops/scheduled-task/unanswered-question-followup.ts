/**
 * Unanswered-question follow-up (#14676): the path from an agent question in
 * ordinary chat to an unprompted nudge when the owner never answers.
 *
 * The pending-prompt / no-reply machinery only ever covered ScheduledTask
 * fires; a question the agent asked in a normal REPLY turn evaporated the
 * moment the turn ended. This module closes the loop with the ONE scheduler:
 *
 *  - On `MESSAGE_SENT` (agent outbound replying to an owner message), a cheap
 *    structural candidate check — does the reply END with a question? — seeds
 *    a `kind: "followup"` ScheduledTask with a `once` trigger. Detection is
 *    only candidacy: whether the nudge is actually worth sending is decided
 *    at fire time by the `model_moment_check` gate (the #14677 moment judge),
 *    which sees the open question, the owner's presence/quiet-streak context,
 *    and can send / defer / drop. `quiet_hours` composes before it as the
 *    hard-constraint backstop.
 *  - On `MESSAGE_RECEIVED` (owner speaks in the room), every still-scheduled
 *    question follow-up for that room is dismissed: the owner re-engaged, so
 *    a delayed nudge about the old turn is stale — if the agent still wants
 *    the answer, the live conversation is where it re-asks (and its next
 *    reply re-registers a fresh follow-up if it ends with a question).
 *  - Once FIRED, the existing spine machinery owns the rest: the scheduler
 *    records a pending prompt, `inbound-reply-completion` completes the task
 *    when the owner answers, and the completion timeout lets it go quietly
 *    (kind `followup` has no no-reply ladder — one nudge, never a chase).
 *
 * At most one scheduled question follow-up exists per room: registering a new
 * one dismisses its predecessor (the newest agent question supersedes).
