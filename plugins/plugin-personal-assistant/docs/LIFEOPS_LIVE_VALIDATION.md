# LifeOps live owner/agent validation matrix (#8833)

The static LifeOps split (personal-assistant + per-domain plugins) is done and
the 10 split views were audited `good` on desktop + mobile (see issue #8833
comments). What remains is **live, account-backed validation** across the OWNER
and AGENT sides, native devices, and OAuth/provider state — work that cannot be
proven in unit tests because it depends on real credentials and devices.

This document is the durable QA matrix for that pass: the prerequisites, the
exact states to exercise per connector, the expected behavior, and the
skip rules when credentials/devices are absent. Fill the **Result** columns in a
copy under the local scratch dir `reports/lifeops-live-validation/<session>/`
(gitignored — evidence is never committed to the repo) and attach the redacted
screenshots / logs **inline in the PR/issue** per
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md) (MP4 video, JPG screenshots, logs in
a `<details>` block).

## How to run a live session

```bash
# 1. Provide working credentials in .env (see "Env vars" per connector below),
#    then confirm readiness on the credential dashboard (values masked to last-4):
bun run lifeops:hitl                    # scripts/lifeops/hitl-credential-dashboard.mjs
# 2. Boot the local app (Eliza API on :31337, dashboard on :2138):
bun run dev
# 3. Open the dashboard and complete first-run onboarding as the OWNER:
open http://localhost:2138
# 4. Drive the credential-gated live lanes (matrix harness + live connector
#    suites; each lane skips cleanly when its creds are absent):
node scripts/lifeops/run-11632-live-lanes.mjs
# 5. Capture the populated views: open the /lifeops-live-test view, then
bun run --cwd packages/app audit:app    # desktop + mobile screenshots per view
bun run test:e2e:record                 # recorded walkthrough for the PR video
# 6. Drive each view/action below as OWNER, then repeat as a non-owner AGENT
#    identity to confirm the permission matrix. Stage all artifacts under
#    reports/lifeops-live-validation/<session>/ and attach them inline on the
#    PR/issue per CONTRIBUTING.md.
```

The HITL runner tracks this lane as the `lifeops-live` group
(`node scripts/hitl/run-hitl.mjs --groups=lifeops-live` — see
`docs/testing/hitl-inventory.md`); it is intentionally outside the golden-path
default because it requires real credentials and devices.

> **Agent responses require a working model provider.** If the model keys in

> generate replies and connector actions that route through the planner cannot

## OWNER vs AGENT permission matrix (run for every connector/action)

For each owner-only action surface, exercise and record evidence for:

| # | State | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Unauthenticated connector | Clear "not connected" affordance; no silent failure |
| 2 | OWNER authenticated + authorized | Action succeeds; typed `DispatchResult` returned |
| 3 | AGENT authenticated, not owner-authorized | Denied with a clear permission error (`roleGate`) |
| 4 | Expired / revoked grant | Explicit, recoverable re-auth prompt |
| 5 | Missing required scope | Explicit scope error; no partial mutation |
| 6 | Multiple grants (owner-side must win) | Owner-side grant selected for owner-only ops |
| 7 | Planned-tool execution path | `roleGate` enforced |
| 8 | Direct handler invocation path | Handler-level owner check matches `roleGate` |
| 9 | UI-triggered path from the view | Same outcome as 7/8 |

Expected invariants (all paths): owner-only actions deny non-owner execution;
approval-required outbound actions route through `PgApprovalQueue` (never send
silently); connector calls return typed `DispatchResult` data (never a bare
boolean or a swallowed error).

## Connector families

Legend for **Result**: `pass` · `fail` · `blocked (no creds)` · `n/a`.

| Connector | Owner actions | Env vars / prerequisites | Result (OWNER) | Result (AGENT) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Google Calendar | `CALENDAR` (list/create/update/delete/availability, conflict detect) | OWNER + AGENT Google accounts w/ Calendar scope; OAuth grant | | |
| Gmail / Inbox | `INBOX` (read/search/label/archive; outbound draft→approval) | Gmail scope on same accounts; billing corpus for finances | | |
| Telegram | status/read/send-or-draft | OWNER + AGENT bot/user identities | | |
| Discord | status/read/send-or-draft | OWNER + AGENT identities | | |
| Signal | status/read/send | linked device | | |
| WhatsApp | status/read/send | `ELIZA_WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `ELIZA_WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID` | | |
| iMessage | status/read/send | macOS + `ELIZA_IMESSAGE_BACKEND` | | |
| X | status/read/post | OWNER + AGENT identities | | |
| Slack | status/read/send | workspace tokens (if deployed) | | |
| Phone / SMS / Voice | `VOICE_CALL` (outbound call/SMS, approval) | Twilio test number + recipient allowlist | | |
| Health | `OWNER_HEALTH` (sync, permission, error paths) | Apple Health/HealthKit, Google Fit/Health Connect, Fitbit/Oura/Strava/Withings | | |
| Screen-time / Focus | `OWNER_SCREENTIME`, `BLOCK` (macOS-only) | macOS hosts/SelfControl admin; iOS Family Controls; Android Usage Access | | |
| Finances | `OWNER_FINANCES` (subscription detect, import, approval) | Gmail billing corpus / CSV fixture / Plaid or PayPal sandbox | | |
| Documents | `OWNER_DOCUMENTS` (search/review/signature) | document store + signature provider | | |

## Split views (each on desktop + mobile)

View-rendering + aesthetics already audited `good` (issue #8833 comment). For
the **live-data** pass, record empty / loading / error / populated states, plus
refresh/retry and "agent-created data shows up in the view":

`/calendar` · `/scheduling` (reminders) · `/goals` · `/inbox` · `/health` ·
`/focus` (blocker) · `/finances` · `/documents` · `/relationships` ·
`/phone` (+ `/phone/tui`). Confirm any remaining `#lifeops` deep links/aliases
in `packages/app` still resolve.

## Skip behavior for absent credentials

Live tests must skip (not fail) when their credentials/devices are absent, so a
minimal checkout stays green:

- Connector live tests are gated behind their env var(s) — e.g. an `it.skipIf`
  on the access token / sandbox key; skipped runs log the missing prerequisite.
- The LifeOps prompt benchmark now lives in the standalone benchmarks repo
  (https://github.com/elizaOS/benchmarks) and runs there, not in this package.
- Native-device flows (HealthKit, Family Controls, SMS default-role) require a
  real device/simulator and are out of scope for headless CI.

## Acceptance (per #8833)

- [ ] Every connector family has OWNER and AGENT evidence (or `blocked` w/ reason).
- [ ] Every owner-only action denies non-owner via planned-tool, direct-handler, and UI paths.
- [ ] Every split view checked desktop + mobile across empty/loading/error/populated.
- [ ] OAuth / native-permission failures are explicit and recoverable.
- [ ] Live connector failures return typed results (no silent success).
- [ ] Approval-gated outbound flows validated end to end.
- [ ] This matrix records exactly which accounts, devices, scopes, env vars, and sandboxes were used.
- [ ] Any discovered bug has a linked issue/PR before the issue is closed.
