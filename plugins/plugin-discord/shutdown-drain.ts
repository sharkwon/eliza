/**
 * Tracks Discord message turns currently being processed by
 * `MessageManager#handleMessage` and the status-reaction controller (if any)
 * each one is driving, so `DiscordService#stop` can wait for outstanding
 * work to finish — bounded — instead of destroying the client mid-turn, and
 * can force-reconcile any status reaction still showing "in progress" when
 * that bound elapses.
 *
 * The two halves are tracked in SEPARATE maps, and each retires on its own
 * completion. An earlier revision kept one entry per turn and retired it only
 * once both halves finished, which coupled the registry's liveness to every
 * caller remembering to drive its controller terminal: one throw that skipped
 * that left the entry resident for the process lifetime, and every later
 * `stop()` then burned the full drain timeout on it. Draining the UNION of
 * both maps keeps the property that motivated the coupling — a turn whose
 * handler has settled while its reaction is still mid-chain is still visible
 * to `drain` — without the shared lifetime (#17749 review, @wtfsayo then
 * @lalalune).
 *
 * Scope note: this registry drains turns that were already in flight when
 * `drain` is called. It does not stop new inbound messages from starting a
 * new turn while the drain is in progress — discord.js keeps delivering
 * gateway events until the client is destroyed, and this connector has no
 * ingress cordon (elizaOS/eliza#16318 scopes an inbound cordon to the
 * runtime-level shutdown path, outside this plugin). A turn that starts
 * after `drain` begins is not covered by that call.
