# @elizaos/plugin-discord

Discord connector plugin for elizaOS — connects an Eliza agent to Discord servers via the Discord.js gateway.

## Purpose / role

This plugin registers the `DiscordService` (and companion services) with the elizaOS runtime, giving an Eliza agent the ability to send and receive messages, handle voice, manage slash commands, track permission changes, and bridge the Discord desktop app via a local IPC connector. It has two config-selected modes in one package: **bot-API mode** (`DiscordService`, activated by `DISCORD_API_TOKEN` / `DISCORD_BOT_TOKENS`) and **local desktop mode** (`DiscordLocalService`, activated by `DISCORD_LOCAL_CLIENT_ID` + `DISCORD_LOCAL_CLIENT_SECRET`); each service self-gates on its own credentials and stays dormant otherwise, so the modes can run independently or together. The former `@elizaos/plugin-discord-local` package is merged into this one (its old package name aliases here via the agent plugin collector). It is auto-enabled when `discord` appears in the character's connector keys (`autoEnable.connectorKeys: ["discord"]`). No actions or providers are registered; all behavior flows through services and events.

## Plugin surface

### Services
| Name | Type key | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DiscordService` | `"discord"` | Main gateway service (bot-API mode) — connects to Discord API, handles messages, voice, slash commands, reactions, history backfill, and emits `DiscordEventTypes.*` events |
| `DiscordLocalService` | `"discord-local"` | Local mode — IPC connector to the Discord desktop app (OAuth over the local RPC socket + macOS UI-automation replies). Dormant unless `DISCORD_LOCAL_CLIENT_ID` / `DISCORD_LOCAL_CLIENT_SECRET` are configured |
| `DiscordOwnerPairingServiceImpl` | `"OWNER_PAIRING_DISCORD"` | Registers the `/eliza-pair` slash command; relays pairing codes to the backend owner-bind service and DMs login links |
| `DiscordUserAccountScraperImpl` | `"discord_user_account_scraper"` | Scrapes message history and DM inboxes from the Discord desktop app via CDP/browser automation |

### Routes (registered with `rawPath: true`)
| Method | Path | File | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/setup/discord/status` | `setup-routes.ts` | OAuth/IPC connection state |

## Config / env vars

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DISCORD_API_TOKEN` | **Yes** | Bot token used to log in the Discord gateway client |
| `DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID` | **Yes** | Discord application (client) ID — used for slash command registration and invite URL generation |
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKENS` | No | Comma-separated multi-account tokens (multi-account mode alternative to `DISCORD_API_TOKEN`) |
| `CHANNEL_IDS` | No | Comma-separated channel IDs the bot is restricted to (whitelist) |
| `DISCORD_LISTEN_CHANNEL_IDS` | No | Comma-separated channel IDs where the bot ingests messages but does NOT reply |
| `DISCORD_VOICE_CHANNEL_ID` | No | Voice channel ID to auto-join on guild scan; defaults to most-populated channel |
| `DISCORD_SHOULD_IGNORE_BOT_MESSAGES` | No | `"true"` to ignore messages from other bots. Default: `false` — the bot engages other bots (agent-to-agent chat is first-class); the core bot-noise triage (`ELIZA_BOT_NOISE_TRIAGE`, on by default) still pre-filters unaddressed webhook/bot group chatter. See `DISCORD_DEFAULTS` in `environment.ts`. |
| `DISCORD_SHOULD_IGNORE_DIRECT_MESSAGES` | No | `"false"` to process DMs (default: `true`) |
| `DISCORD_SHOULD_RESPOND_ONLY_TO_MENTIONS` | No | `"true"` to reply only when @-mentioned. Default: `false` — the bot replies in-channel without requiring a mention. |
| `DISCORD_DM_POLICY` | No | DM access policy: `open` / `allowlist` / `pairing` / `disabled` (default: `pairing`) |
| `DISCORD_ALLOW_FROM` | No | Comma-separated Discord user IDs allowed under the `allowlist` DM policy |
| `ELIZA_DISCORD_OWNER_USER_IDS_JSON` | No | JSON array of Discord user IDs that should alias to the canonical Eliza owner entity. Use only for the actual owner or deliberate owner aliases; Discord application team members are kept as separate entities; accepted, non-read-only members are seeded as connector admins (pending invitees and `read_only` members get no standing), and more can be added via `ELIZA_ROLES_CONNECTOR_ADMINS_JSON`. |
| `DISCORD_AUTO_REPLY` | No | `"false"` to ingest messages into memory without generating replies. Default: `true` — the bot auto-answers. |
| `DISCORD_USER_INSTALL` | No | `"false"` for a guild-only app not portal-configured for user install. Default: `true` — commands register as user-installable and available in group DMs / DMs-with-others (contexts guild+bot-DM+private-channel, integration types guild+user install). **Requires the Discord app be configured as "User Install" in the developer portal** (Installation settings), or Discord rejects registration — see the setup docs. |
| `DISCORD_STATUS_REACTIONS` | No | Scope of the acknowledgement emoji reaction on handled inbound messages: `all` / `group-mentions` / `none` (default: `all`). |
| `DISCORD_SYNC_PROFILE` | No | `"false"` to skip bot profile sync on startup (default: `true`) |
| `DISCORD_IPC_DIR` | No | Override the IPC socket directory searched by `DiscordLocalService` when connecting to the Discord desktop app |
| `DISCORD_LOCAL_CLIENT_ID` | No | Discord application client ID for local (desktop IPC) mode — with `DISCORD_LOCAL_CLIENT_SECRET`, activates `DiscordLocalService` |
| `DISCORD_LOCAL_CLIENT_SECRET` | No | Discord application client secret for local mode |
| `DISCORD_LOCAL_ENABLED` | No | `"false"` to disable local mode even when local credentials are set (default: enabled when credentials present) |
| `DISCORD_LOCAL_SCOPES` | No | Comma-separated OAuth scopes for local mode (default `rpc,identify,rpc.notifications.read`) |
| `DISCORD_LOCAL_MESSAGE_CHANNEL_IDS` | No | Comma-separated channel IDs to subscribe to `MESSAGE_CREATE` in local mode |
| `DISCORD_LOCAL_SEND_DELAY_MS` | No | Milliseconds to wait after focusing Discord before typing in local mode (default 900, min 100) |
| `DISCORD_GENERATION_TIMEOUT_MS` | No | Milliseconds cap for generation before the pending Discord message is discarded |
| `MESSAGE_TIMEOUT_MS` | No | Fallback generation timeout in ms (used when `DISCORD_GENERATION_TIMEOUT_MS` is not set) |
| `DISCORD_TEST_CHANNEL_ID` | No | Channel used by `DiscordTestSuite` |

All settings can also be provided in the character file under `settings.discord` (as `DiscordConfig` / `DiscordAccountConfig`) — character settings override env vars.

## How to extend

**Add a new slash command** — either call `addCommand(commandSpec)` (from `slash-commands.ts`) with a `SlashCommand`-shaped object that includes an `execute(interaction, runtime)` function, or emit the `DISCORD_REGISTER_COMMANDS` event with an array of `DiscordSlashCommand` objects (from `types.ts`) for external registration. Handle responses by listening for `DISCORD_SLASH_COMMAND` or `DISCORD_MODAL_SUBMIT` events.

**Add a new event handler** — subscribe to a `DiscordEventTypes.*` string event on the runtime from any plugin or service. All event payload types are in `types.ts` (`DiscordEventPayloadMap`).

**Add a new HTTP route** — append a `Route` object to `discordSetupRoutes` (in `setup-routes.ts`) or `discordDataRoutes` (in `data-routes.ts`), or export a new route array from a new file and add it to the `routes` array in `index.ts`.

**Add a new service** — create a class extending `Service` from `@elizaos/core`, export it, and add it to the `services` array in `index.ts`.

## Conventions / gotchas

- **Discord snowflake IDs are not UUIDs.** Use `stringToUuid(discordId)` to store them in UUID fields. Use `createUniqueUuid(runtime, discordId)` for `worldId`/`roomId` (agent-namespaced). Never use `asUUID()` on raw Discord IDs — it throws.
- **`messageServerId` is the correct field** for server IDs on `Room` and `World` objects (not `serverId`). `compat.ts` is a type-only shim (`ICompatRuntime`/`WorldCompat`/`RoomCompat`) that widens these fields so the code typechecks across core versions — there is no runtime proxy.
- **Native dependencies.** `@discordjs/opus` and `libsodium-wrappers` have native binaries. They must build successfully in the Node.js environment; the plugin does not run in browsers (see `eliza.platforms: ["node"]`).
- **Voice requires ffmpeg.** The `fluent-ffmpeg` dep expects a system `ffmpeg` binary on `PATH` for audio processing.
- **Multi-account mode** is activated by setting `DISCORD_BOT_TOKENS` (comma-separated) instead of `DISCORD_API_TOKEN`. See `accounts.ts` for resolution order.
- **`autoReply` is true by default** in `DiscordSettings` — the agent auto-answers inbound messages. Set `DISCORD_AUTO_REPLY=false` (or `character.settings.discord.autoReply=false`, or the per-account `autoReply`) to ingest messages into memory without replying.
- See root `CLAUDE.md` for repo-wide architecture rules, logger-only logging, ESM conventions, and naming standards.

## Verification

Follow the repository-wide verification and evidence standard in the [root CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md). Run
the package's relevant build, typecheck, lint, and test commands, then exercise
the real integration boundary changed by the work. Inspect the produced domain
artifacts and failure behavior; do not substitute mocked success for the system
under test.
