/**
 * Keyless per-plugin e2e for `@elizaos/plugin-relationships`.
 *
 * Exercises the plugin's `KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH` umbrella action end-to-end against
 * the runtime-owned knowledge graph (no external API, no credentials). The
 * `list` op reads the per-agent EntityStore (backed by the SQL plugin's
 * app_lifeops tables) and reports the entities in the graph — fully
 * deterministic, no model calls.
 *
 * Two scenario-runtime facts shape this scenario:
 *
 *  1. The core runtime ships a built-in `native-features` plugin whose internal
 *     name is also "relationships". Scenario-runner normalizes the required
 *     package "@elizaos/plugin-relationships" to that same "relationships" name,
 *     so it treats the package as already registered and never auto-loads the
 *     real plugin that owns KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH. The seed therefore registers that
 *     action directly (the same synthetic registration scenario-runner uses for
 *     plugin-app-control).
 *
 *  2. `KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH` is an op-dispatched action with no declared `parameters`
 *     schema (op/kind/limit are read from `options.parameters` and validated
 *     per-op in the handler). Under the strict model provider the planner tool schema
 *     is closed, so a tool-call cannot carry the `op` argument. The action is
 *     therefore driven directly via an `action` turn with `options.parameters`,
 *     which runs the real handler against the real KnowledgeGraphService.
