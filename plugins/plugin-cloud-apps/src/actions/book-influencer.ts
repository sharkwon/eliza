/**
 * BOOK_INFLUENCER (#10687) — the agent hires an influencer to promote, with a
 * two-phase money confirm.
 *
 *   1. First ask NEVER moves money: it resolves the influencer + amount + brief,
 *      persists a pending confirmation (safety.ts), and asks the user to confirm.
 *   2. On a later turn carrying the planner's structured `confirm: true` for that
 *      pending prompt, it funds the escrowed booking via `client.createBooking`
 *      (the advertiser's own org credits are debited into escrow; released to the
 *      influencer on approval, refunded on rejection — no external keys).
 *
 * Guardrails shared with the other gated actions:
 *   - at most ONE pending booking per room (a fresh pending re-prompts; a stale
 *     one is replaced), and a pending older than CONFIRM_TTL_MS refuses the
 *     bare confirm (safety.ts),
 *   - a budget needs an explicit currency cue — a bare number in the message is
 *     never treated as dollars,
 *   - influencer names resolve through the ambiguity-aware matcher (client.ts);
 *     ties ask the user instead of booking a lookalike profile,
 *   - the pending is deleted only AFTER the fund call resolves (#11844): its
 *     taskId is the sole holder of the escrow idempotency key
 *     (`influencer-confirm-<taskId>`), so on a transport-level failure the
 *     pending is kept and marked `recovery: true` — a re-confirm re-sends the
 *     SAME key and the server resumes/dedupes the exact booking (its funding
 *     resume) instead of funding a second escrow.
