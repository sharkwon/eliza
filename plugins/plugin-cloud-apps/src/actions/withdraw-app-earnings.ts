/**
 * WITHDRAW_APP_EARNINGS — MONEY-OUT. Handled with maximum care.
 *
 * ── Safety model (documented per PR_EVIDENCE) ────────────────────────────────
 * Two layers protect the user's money, and NO secret/credential ever transits a
 * connector:
 *
 *   1. Two-phase confirm (structured `confirm` + pending task in safety.ts).
 *      The first ask NEVER moves money — it returns a confirmation prompt naming
 *      the exact app + amount, plus a connector-agnostic CTA to the dashboard
 *      earnings page. Money moves only when a later turn carries structured
 *      `confirm: true` for that pending prompt.
 *
 *   2. The "safe path" on confirm calls `client.withdrawAppEarnings(id, …)`,
 *      which wraps `POST /api/v1/apps/:id/earnings/withdraw`. That endpoint is
 *      idempotent (accepts an `idempotency_key`) and SERVER-GATED: the server
 *      independently verifies org ownership, app-creator identity, monetization,
 *      the minimum-payout threshold, and a sufficient withdrawable balance. It
 *      does NOT itself wire cash to a bank — it records the withdrawal request
 *      and moves the funds into the creator's redeemable balance; the actual
 *      cash-out (admin-gated Stripe Connect transfer / token redemption) is
 *      completed by the user IN THE BROWSER via the CTA. We therefore call the
 *      safe, idempotent, server-gated request endpoint on confirm AND hand off
 *      the dashboard CTA so the user finishes the money/credential step there.
 *
 * The CTA ({@link buildConnectorCta}) carries ONLY a human label + an https URL —
 * never a token, signed payload, secret, or amount baked into a credential.
