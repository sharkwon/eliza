/**
 * App-deployment guidance for spawned coding sub-agents.
 *
 * When a sub-agent is asked to build an app / website, the planner-level
 * app-build contract (in the parent agent's system prompt) does not survive the
 * terse spawn task. Without it the sub-agent just writes local files that are
 * never served, so the user gets "no live URL". This module re-injects a
 * deployment contract into the sub-agent's initial task at the spawn chokepoint
 * so the result is actually hosted and a verified URL is reported.
 *
 * Default target is **Eliza Cloud** (the productized path for every user).
 * Cloud register + deploy are BROKER-FIRST (#14118): the guidance tells the
 * child to run `cloud-command apps.create` / `containers.create` through the
 * parent-agent broker (spend-capped, confirmation-gated) rather than curling the
 * Cloud API with a raw owner key it no longer receives by default. The only
 * genuine value a self-serving monetized container still needs — the owner's
 * cloud key as its own runtime bearer (`environmentVars.ELIZA_CLOUD_API_KEY`,
 * since `ELIZAOS_CLOUD_API_KEY` is a platform-reserved container key #9853) —
 * comes from the owner-approved credential bridge, not a raw env leak.
 *
 * An operator can point the agent at their own **custom static host** entirely
 * through config (a per-user apps dir + public base URL); the framework carries
 * NO knowledge of any specific host — the operator's private character/env
 * config supplies the values, so a personal host is never baked into the repo.
 *
