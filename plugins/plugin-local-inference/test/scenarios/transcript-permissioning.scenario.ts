/**
 * Deterministic per-plugin e2e for the transcript permissioning actions of
 * `@elizaos/plugin-local-inference` (issue #14779): the message -> planner ->
 * `SHARE_TRANSCRIPT` -> `TranscriptStore` path proven end to end, not at the
 * unit boundary.
 *
 * The seed writes one meeting transcript containing PII (email + phone) into
 * the transcripts partition, owned by the scenario's ADMIN requester. The turn
 * asks the agent to share it with a non-privileged colleague, redacted. The
 * planner fixture routes to `SHARE_TRANSCRIPT` with `mode: "redacted"`, which
 * mints the deterministic redacted variant and writes a per-entity grant on the
 * original row.
 *
 * The effect proof reads the store back the way the API route does — through
 * the ONE role-aware disclosure predicate (#14781): the colleague (USER, with
 * the redacted grant) gets the variant served under the original id with audio
 * withheld and PII scrubbed, while an ADMIN viewer gets the untouched original
 * with audio and raw PII intact. Handler success without those two disclosures
 * differing is not proof, so the check fails on either leak or missing redaction.
