/**
 * Memory Arbiter — single in-process owner of every model handle (text,
 * embedding, vision-language, ASR, TTS, image generation) for the local
 * inference stack. WS1 deliverable.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * The current code has every plugin loading independently:
 *
 *   - `plugin-local-inference` owns the text + voice GGUFs through
 *     `LocalInferenceEngine` + `SharedResourceRegistry`.
 *   - `plugin-vision` loads its own TF.js / face-api models with no
 *     shared budget.
 *   - `plugin-native-inference` runs the bun:ffi llama.cpp binding
 *     in its own world, also with no shared budget.
 *
 * On a 6 GB iPhone or an 8 GB low-tier Android, that means loading a
 * vision model on top of a text model gets the app jetsam'd / lmkd-killed
 * before the planner even runs.
 *
 * The arbiter is the single seam every consumer goes through to acquire
 * a model. It owns the eviction policy across modalities (the existing
 * `ResidentModelRole` priority table + memory-pressure signals from the
 * platform), it owns the queue for capability swaps (a vision-describe
 * arriving while the text model is generating waits its turn rather than
 * triggering a parallel load that OOMs), and it owns the
 * `vision-embedding-cache` so repeat frames don't re-pay the projector.
 *
 * What this module does NOT do
 * ----------------------------
 *   - It does not implement any model loader. Loaders are passed in via
 *     `registerCapability(...)` by the plugins that own the binding
 *     (plugin-local-inference for text/embedding, plugin-vision for
 *     vision-describe, plugin-image-gen for diffusion, etc.).
 *   - It does not download models, probe hardware, or render UI. Those
 *     are the existing `Downloader`, `probeHardware`, and Settings UI
 *     concerns.
 *   - It does not run on a worker thread. One process, one event loop —
 *     the arbiter coordinates async work via promises only.
 *
 * Consumer contract
 * -----------------
 * Capability handlers register themselves at boot:
 *
 *   ```ts
 *   arbiter.registerCapability({
 *     capability: "vision-describe",
 *     residentRole: "vision",
 *     load: async (modelKey) => loadVisionModel(modelKey),
 *     unload: async (handle) => handle.dispose(),
 *     run: async (handle, req) => handle.describe(req.imageBytes),
 *   });
 *   ```
 *
 * Then anyone can call:
 *
 *   ```ts
 *   const result = await arbiter.requestVisionDescribe({
 *     modelKey: "gemma-vl-4b",
 *     imageBytes: pixels,
 *   });
 *   ```
 *
 * The arbiter handles:
 *   1. Acquiring (or reusing) the handle for `gemma-vl-4b`.
 *   2. If a different capability holds the active model and we need to
 *      swap, evicting it first.
 *   3. Running the request.
 *   4. Releasing the handle (refcounted; the handle stays loaded until
 *      pressure or idle eviction reclaims it).
 *
 * Telemetry
 * ---------
 * The arbiter emits typed events:
 *   - `model_load`     — a handle came online (capability, modelKey, ms)
 *   - `model_unload`   — a handle went offline (capability, modelKey, reason)
 *   - `memory_pressure` — pressure level changed (level, source, freeMb?)
 *   - `eviction`       — a role was evicted (capability, modelKey, reason)
 *   - `capability_run` — a request completed (capability, modelKey, ms)
 *
 * The runtime observability layer subscribes via `onEvent(...)`.
